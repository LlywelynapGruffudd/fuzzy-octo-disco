EVTNAMEOCC.1;The wood is calling me;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_1;It's a beautiful night outside, and I'm sick of staying inside. Perhaps I could take a short stroll in the woods?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAOCC.1;Seems like a great idea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPOCC_1;[Root.GetBestName] sneaks past the guards and heads into the woods;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBOCC.1;On second thought, I can just eat something;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCOCC.1;Wandering alone in the woods at night is a very bad idea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDOCC.1;One more cup of wine and I will forget about it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEOCC.1;Why not? My life is worthless anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFOCC.1;This cute courtier seems more interesting than that...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_2;It's been so long since I've surveyed my lands that I've forgotten how boring camps are at night. The weather is beautiful tonight, why do I have to stay here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAOCC.2;Seems like a great idea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPOCC_2;[Root.GetBestName] sneaks out of the camp and heads into the woods;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBOCC.2;On second thought, I can just eat something;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCOCC.2;Wandering alone in the woods at night is a very bad idea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDOCC.2;Why not? My life is worthless anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEOCC.2;This cute courtier seems more intresting than that...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOCC.3;A pleasant midnight stroll;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_3;I snuck out past the guards and walked off into the woods, blazing my own trail. Soon enough, I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight, and gazing up at the stars. The fresh air makes me feel so alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAOCC.3;I've needed this for too long;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBOCC.3;I feel energized!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_OCC_3;But...why do I feel like I'm being watched?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_4;A gust of cold wind enveloped me, and a deep chill sunk itself deep into my bones. Feeling scared, I fell to my knees, and something rushed me from the trees. Opening my eyes, I found myself at the entrance of a dark, dense thicket, the branches overhead blocking out all but a few thin, silvery rays of moonlight. A tall thin figure, clad in black robes, beckoned me forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAOCC.4;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_OCC_4;[Root.GetBestName] follows into the darkness...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOCC.8;The Dance of the Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_8;The figure led me deeper into the thicket, where we came upon four men gathered about a blazing fire. One was dressed in the regalia of a king -- another, the vestments of a high priest -- the next, the filthy rags of a peasant -- the last, the rich finery of a merchant. They summoned me over to join in with them in the Dance of the Dead...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAOCC.8;What is this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_OCC_8;[Root.GetBestName] is led into the middle of the circle of fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_5;As if time had stopped still, I was numb with fear, but still I wanted to go! And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me as I walked onto the coals! Then we danced, and we pranced, and I sang with them -- all had death in their eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAOCC.5;These dead are so lively!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_OCC_5;[Root.GetBestName] dances with the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOCC.6;Everything ends;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_6;As we dance the circle of death, I feel myself growing lighter, and my mind dulls as I slowly slip into a trance. Suddenly, the dance stops -- the sound of a twig snapping could only mean that my guards are searching for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_OCC_6;Run, run! For the love of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], run!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEOCC.7;Waking up;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_OCC_7;I awoke in my own bed weak and sweating. The servants told me that they had found me alone in a clearing, my clothing charred and tattered but I miraculously unharmed. I asked them about the skeletons and the thicket, but they just looked at me with worried eyes and shook their heads. It seems I am the only living witness to these events.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_OCC_7;[Root.GetBestName] takes off into the undergrowth, and doesn't look back!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_OCC_7;No I'll never go dancing no more, 'till I dance with the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
