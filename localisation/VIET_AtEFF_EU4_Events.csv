#EU4 Event;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.0.desc;Rumors abound that the location of a sunken treasure fleet has been discovered. Wrecked by a raging hurricane, the lost ship is said to have taken some one thousand sailors and millions of dollars to its watery grave.Now that its purported location is widely know it is sure to attract opportunistic salvagers and perhaps even the ship's authorities seeking to recover their gold.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.0.a;Arrange an ambush for would-be salvagers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.0.b;Lower the diving bell. The gold will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.1.desc;Our latest prize turned out to be carrying a much more valuable cargo than expected. This fact has not yet been revealed to the crews, who would expect and demand that the additional plunder be added to their share. The captains of the involved ships wish sequester the money to refit their ships and purchase additional weapon, while the fence’s representative argues that it is best spent on bribing officials in legitimate ports. As an argument breaks out, a drunken crewman stumbles into the room and hears too much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.1.a;Divide it evenly amongst the crew.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.1.b;The fence will take their cut.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.1.c;The Captain will receive an extra share.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.2.desc;It is time once again to careen the ships. This arduous process requires the crews to drag the ships onto a secure beach at high tide and safely lower them onto their sides to expose the hull for repairs. It is a task dreaded by every pirate, not only because the risk of damage to the ship and injury to the crew is high but because of the backbreaking labor they must perform to see the job done right. Several advocates among the crew feel that a more relaxed approach should be taken to careening, despite the captain’s insistence that failing to make the proper repairs will cause far more problems down the line.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.2.a;Ensure the crews do a thorough job.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETeu.2.b;Let the crews relax.;;;;;;;;;;;x
