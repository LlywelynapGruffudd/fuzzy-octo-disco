VIETmisc.8000.desc;Last night [Root.GetSheHeOpp] appeared in my dream, and we laughed and danced and talked about nothing in particular. My heart was beating so fast, for I was so nervous yet excited that even when I woke up I could still feel it. It has been so long, so many years since we last met, yet even now I still think about [Root.GetHerHimOpp].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8000.a;We were so young and innocent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.desc;I idly sit at court one day when I see one of my young servants staring across the hall at one of my maids for far too long. She notices and looks at him, confused. He immediately jerks his head away, embarrassed, awkwardly avoiding her gaze. It's old news that he finds her attractive but hasn't worked up the courage to tell her, and she is too oblivious to know any better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.a;He will find courage soon, or she a brain. It'll work out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.b;Silly boy and girl. Fanciful, stupid, fleeting feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.c;Ah, youth!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.d;I sympathize with him. People are scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.b.tooltip;It's not like I was in love with anyone that way or anything like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8002.desc;I don't know why, but I am feeling quite happy and inspired today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8002.a;It's a good feeling!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8003.desc;I saw a crab in the mud the other day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8003.a;Horrible creatures! I avoid them whenever I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.desc;I am in town one day when I hear a guard shout, "STOP, YOU VIOLATED THE LAW!"\n\nWith superhuman speed, he catches a thief and drags the criminal to jail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.a;Most remarkable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.b;Impressive. Reward the guard for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.c;I like him. Why don't we bring him to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.desc;I did not approve of what [target_VIET_inappropriate_courtier.GetFullName] said. It was vulgar and inappropriate for the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.a;I made my stance clear. How disappointing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.b;I hinted it might have been unsuitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.c;I did not say anything for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.desc;A bridge in [Root.GetName] has recently collapsed. As a major thoroughfare connecting various villages in the region, we must fix it as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.a;Send in emergency resources immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.b;Do whatever is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.c;The locals can take care of it themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_bridge_fix_sooner;\nThe bridge is fixed in a quick timeframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_bridge_fix_okay;\nThe bridge is fixed in a reasonable timeframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_bridge_fix_bad;\nThe bridge takes a long while to get fixed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8007.desc;The sky over [Root.GetName] turned several colors at once, unnatural hues of purple, red, green, blue, pink, and more. This lasted many days and though there were no known effects, the inhabitants of the region are bewildered. None of the local learned men nor mystics could explain this phenomenon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8007.a;Who knows what mysterious forces are at play here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_famous_bard_settles;The bard settles down in your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.desc;A famous bard has settled down in [Root.GetName]. Though his music and singing is sublime, he refuses to perform for the wealthy and powerful, even when offered exorbitant amounts of riches. Instead, he prefers to entertain the poor and the masses, inspiring and uplifting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.a;He shall be arrested for his insolence!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.b;If he wishes to associate with commoners, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.c;I can understand his reasons in all honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8009.desc;Disturbing reports from [Root.GetName]. A mysterious wooden ship has been spotted floating in the sky along the far horizon in several areas along the coast. The few ships that tried to approach could never reach it, and it does not fly the flag or banner of any known peoples. Wherever it was spotted, locals reported hearing strange, whistling noises, like a faint, screeching wind, in the night for several weeks afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8009.a;Alarming apparitions....;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8009.b;Probably just some peasant hysteria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.desc;A peasant in [Root.GetName] got lost recently while trekking near the wilderness. She came across a flat, vertical stone surface where the ancient rulers of the region carved various images and inscriptions. After she reported this to the local officials, you sent in people to investigate and it appears this stone is the last remnants of an imposing ancient monument! The stone can't be re-used, so it must stand where it is, perhaps for all eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.a;Quite a sight to behold!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.b;Heathen symbol. Discourage people from visiting it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.c;This is a holy place - build an altar near it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.d;Send a few antiquitarians to study it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8011.desc;A sandstorm recently swept through [Root.GetName] at a most inopportune time. A large number of people perished, including some soldiers who were on patrol. Furthermore, there was some damage to local infrastructure and buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8011.a;Troubling news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.desc;You spot two of your courtiers talking one day. Having nothing to do at that particular moment, you walk up to them, but when they notice you they immediately stop their conversation. "Is something wrong?" you ask.\n\n"Nothing," one of them says, as the other one raises an eyebrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.a;Suspicious. Very suspicious....;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.b;This is awkward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.c;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.d;I'll apologize - I'm sure they had their reasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.desc;Someone is asking me for recommendations for good reading. By coincidence, just yesterday I finished reading a wonderful book. I enjoyed it greatly and would recommend to a lot of people. Specifically, the story is a...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.a;Sappy, dramatic romance about true love.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.b;Gritty, dark tale with bloodshed and deviancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.c;Fantastical adventure to foreign lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.d;Collection of amusing anecdotes about daily life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.desc;I am entertaining some important members of a nearby city today - they include high ranking officials, merchants, scholars, and more. I notice among them is a young man, handsome and of good heart, yet clearly forlorn and disturbed. "Let him be," one of his companions whispers to me. "He is melancholy because of a woman!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.a;What foolishness! I'll set the lad's head straight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.b;Let me reason with the fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.c;What woe! Love is cruel. I can relate to him well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.d;Women? They're nothing but trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.e;I can offer counsel from a lady's perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.tooltip;Perhaps I can help him with his sorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.desc;As I chat with the young man, he tries to play coy but can't deny that his heart is broken. I cannot determine whether because the girl rejected him, is with another man, died, or that some other calamity happened, but it is definite he will never be with her. Clearly he is lovesick, and the girl certainly seems like a really impressive woman worthy of love. What should I tell him?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.a;There are many women. Surely you'll meet another!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.b;Find a busty wench to satisfy your carnal desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.c;Let your love inspire you to do great things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.d;Spoiled idiot! There are worse problems out there!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.desc;You are so dedicated to your work that lately you sometimes take your paperwork with you while you are at the chamberpot. Unfortunately today your hand slipped and the papers fell into the chamberpot itself. These were very important papers, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.a;I must recover them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.b;I think I have learned my lesson about being a workaholic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.c;Thankfully I told my scribe to make some copies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.desc;Brazil, that most august empire, has always been a source of rumors of dubious reliability. Lately, traveling merchants and adventurers relay stories about how the current Empress of Brazil is as powerful and fearsome as she is beautiful and charming. She has a strong grip over the Emperor and is the real authority behind everything, even if she only rules from the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.a;A fanciful tale! A joke, even!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.b;Stranger things have happened in Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.c;It is good women have more power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.d;Tell me more about this great and powerful woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.desc;Polo has been popular among the [Culture.GetName] people for many generations. It is no surprise to hear that the people of Brazil also enjoy it. Though women often play polo in many parts of the world, some claim Brazilian women as the best polo players in the world! It is said Empress and princesses regularly beat the menfolk of the imperial court at the sport.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.a;I wonder what tricks and techniques they use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.b;Ha! As if any woman could do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.c;Surely our women are just as good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.d;I am not a fan of polo either way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.desc;The ocean waters rage and rage and rage around you in your dream, a maddening array of the raw force of nature's destruction, and you are unraveled, helplessly, as you are at their mercy. What is humanity but a speck in the cosmos when compared to all this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.a;Even this I shall overcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.b;We are insignificant to the cosmos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.c;Help! Help! Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.desc;I am visiting the patricians prominent in a nearby town. One of them, a lovely young lady, is reputedly an excellent musician, and after the main meeting provides some informal entertainment for everyone present with her singing and music. She plays music beautifully and I am captivated by her sounds of her music.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.a;How inspiring! How touching!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.b;Give her a large tip.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.c;I want her to become a musician at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.d;I want her at my court, to perform music and other "amusements" for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.tooltip; \n\nSurely she would not refuse such an opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.desc;The lady tells me such a thing would not be possible. She is about to marry a good young man, and cannot bear to leave him alone. She also wishes to continue living in a more familiar setting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.a;What a pity. I understand, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.b;How dare she! It's her loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.c;Why doesn't she and her husband to be come to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_offer_money_to_singer;With a generous offer of money, you convince the young couple to come and join your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.desc;I have heard about people in the some realms live on a vegetarian diet. That is, they refuse to consume meat, often for moral or religious reasons. Clearly there are many different customs around the world, but to subsist without any meat for your entire life? Are there people who would go to such extreme lengths for their beliefs? Does their food even taste good?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.a;Such restraint is admirable!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.b;We were meant to eat meat! Some are prey, others are predators.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.c;Only peasants cannot afford meat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.d;Those who are [Root.Religion.GetName] already avoid some meats.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.e;Customs are different all over the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_vegetarian_similarity_to_kosher_halal;Surely avoiding even more meats is not too big a logical jump.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.desc;A traveler is regaling me with stories, and one piques my interest. He heard from someone who heard from someone else who heard from someone else who met a traveler who once traveled west along the seas and reached a small but beautiful island, a paradise where there is always fruit to be found on trees, and the inhabitants live peaceful lives free of illness and violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.a;An unlikely tale, but an amusing one nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.b;Perhaps one day I shall visited these blessed isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.c;I wonder how their society is structured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.desc;There are those who, after eating, prefer to consume a bit of mint leaves before they clean their teeth in the evening. I have just finished dinner and am preparing for bed, but still have some time to take a bit of mint first. Where do I stand on this important matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.a;Some mint is good and refreshing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.b;I have no need. Teeth cleaning is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.c;Bah! Who bothers? A waste of time for the vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.d;I prefer other herbs actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8025.desc;I fell asleep and dream pleasant dreams, dreams that were happy and lifted my spirits and made me feel better about life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8025.a;But then I woke up the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.desc;A powerful woman such as myself has many enemies, so I must be constantly surrounded by sturdy, strong bodyguards who will protect me. It helps that many of these young men are well built and aesthetically pleasing. However, some people are spreading malicious rumors, saying these strapping young men are nothing but my lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.a;Preposterous. I am not that sort of woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.b;Admiring eye candy is one thing, actions are another.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.c;I can't blame them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.d;The others are jealous of my power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.desc;A young noblewoman has come to me today seeking advice on what sort of man makes a good husband. As a highly respected lady, I command much prestige and she wants my input on the matter. After discussing the best personality and backgrounds, she asked me what sort of man I found aesthetically pleasing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.a;I prefer leaner, slimmer types.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.b;Those of average build - neither extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.c;Only the bulky, muscular kinds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8028.desc;Whispers of the ghost of [Root.GetName] have reached your court. Many sightings have been reported along the cliffs by several coastal villages, of how every evening the faint trace of a ghost appears and gazes into the waters for a few hours before disappearing. The ghost is not malevolent at all, and at most merely points, almost dreamlike, towards something which most likely we cannot see nor understand. A few even claimed that the ghost has guided wayward travelers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8028.a;What a ghost story!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.desc;There are scholars who claim that one day, we will be able to make contraptions that allow us to fly like birds. Other thinkers say this is an impossibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.a;If we can dream it, then it is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.b;Let us be realistic here - we are not birds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.c;To do so would be an affront to the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.d;It is theoretically plausible - physically if we just....;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8030.desc;Although you had a full night's of rest the quality of the sleep must not have been good, because you are feeling drowsy today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8030.a;I have to stay awake!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8030.b;Maybe a quick nap will do me good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8031.desc;The muscles in my shoulders feel sore all of a sudden.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8031.a;This will be a problem. Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8032.desc;Today I met some important guests from a distant land, but in the middle of our conversation, I got a most terrible foot cramp! Everyone looked around as I held my foot, groaning in pain. My translator tried to explain to the foreigners what was going on, to which they seemed to understand and awkwardly try to comfort me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8032.a;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8033.desc;The traveling merchant shows me a so-called hourglass. It is not a particularly common tool, but it can measure time much more accurately than most contemporary methods. Perhaps I should buy one for personal use!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8033.a;And I shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8033.b;I have no need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.desc;A farmer was digging in the countryside when he found small ruins from a bygone era. Though these ruins may be of interest to antiquitarians, not much was found, as looters already took most of its valuables over the centuries - except, that is, an ancient clay pot that still looks beautiful and exquisite despite its age, clearly the work of a skilled craftsman. The farmer offers it to you, his liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.a;Good, it'll make for a nice piece of decoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.b;Compensate the farmer for his efforts before taking it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.c;Nay, the farmer can keep it since he found it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8035.desc;There is a traveling scholar staying at my court for a brief while. He owns many impressive instruments, many which he says would take him too long to explain the purpose of, but a seemingly simple magnifying glass piques your interest, for it has been crafted with care and looks quite nice. The scholar says he is willing to sell you it for a good price before he departs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8035.a;Sounds like a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8035.b;That's fine, I just think it looks nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8036.desc;I was bored one day and noticed a beautiful looking calliper inside a box. Few are as finely crafted and exquisite in quality, so I asked a maid about it. "Maybe long ago you could find calipers in every household across [Root.Location.GetName], but not anymore," the maid says, "Especially one of this quality." As a [Root.GetTitle], I can obviously keep it if I like it, she adds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8036.a;Why not. It's beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8036.b;I am not a caliper collector.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.desc;Brazilian travelers are staying at my court. Leading them is the daughter of a Brazilian official of the great [offmap_china.GetName]. I wanted to show her my manor or the nearby town, but she insists on exploring the local scenery and ancient ruins. She is adventurous, so say her traveling companions, who seem unaffected by her antics, in contrast with your scandalized courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.a;What a spirited young lady! I like her spark.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.b;If she wishes it, I shall oblige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.c;This is inappropriate! Women are weak, and it's dangerous out there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.d;She is under my protection, so I can't let her wander off like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8038.tooltip; \n\nDespite the protests of some of your courtiers, you allow her to go as she wishes. She is clearly no dainty flower!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8038.desc;The young Brazilian lady was most impressed with the local surroundings. She tells me her husband is an open-minded scholar and historian back in Brazil, and the two of them enjoy discussing ancient cultures and peoples. She will definitely share her observations with her husband when she returns home, and he will undoubtedly write a glowing account of my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8038.a;I am flattered!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8039.desc;As night fell, I found myself alone in my chambers. Suddenly - and I don't know how it started - I just began crying. I sobbed for what must have been hours, letting out all my pain and sadness. When it stopped, I felt a little better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8039.a;But things aren't over. Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8040.desc;I am drinking an excellently prepared herbal tea made using the horehound herb, said to help with digestion and breathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8040.a;Ah! What relaxing tea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8041.desc;For centuries, Prodnanici have drank so-called mountain tea, made from the sweet tasting ironwort plant. Today I am drinking some to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8041.a;How sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8042.desc;Black tea, also known as red tea, is considered a precious commodity in this part of the world. I have been given several blocks of dried black tea as a gift. They are said to come across the sea so their quality should be very high, and I can present these to guests at various banquets and functions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8042.a;Very good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8043.desc;I added too much salt to my food and it now tastes disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8043.a;Ugh!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8043.b;I will try to eat it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.desc;My cook asks me whether I prefer hard-boiled eggs or soft-boiled eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.a;Soft.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.b;Hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.c;Whatever my cook prefers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.d;I want to abstain from eggs for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8045.desc;I am attending a ball when I met a most interesting fellow! He introduces himself as "an old sea captain and rover, now a shipowner and fat merchant." Cheerful and cordial, he offers you some advice: "Go down to the sea, stand a while. Watch the sun rise and set. Think on the distant lands across the water.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8045.a;The man is friendly, and the two of you end up talking for quite a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.desc;While in the middle of reviewing some paperwork, the dust must have gotten to my nose and I sneezed! According to [Root.Culture.GetName] superstition, if one sneezes in the middle of work, it is a bad omen and one must interrupt the flow of work - such as by stopping to drink some water - to prevent any misfortune from happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.a;Just superstition. Let's continue work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.b;It's silly, but just to be safe I'll drink some water.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.c;Oh no! Get me some water, quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.desc;[Root.Culture.GetName] belief holds it that if one sneezes, it means someone is talking about you behind your back. Sneeze a certain amount of times, and you'll know what they said. One sneeze means good things, two means bad things, and three means they love you. Today, while talking with a number of people, I happened to sneeze very loudly...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.a;One time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.b;Two times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.c;Three times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8048.desc;My chefs prepared an inordinate amount of baklava for a small banquet I was hosting, and I ended up eating most of the baklava! Few could blame me, though - it was very good baklava.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8048.a;I'm sorry about that, but also not sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8049.desc;Recently, pistachios from [Root.GetName] have become very popular in the region. It must be something related to their taste or texture. Exports will likely continue to grow in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8049.a;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.desc;Some of your courtiers are engaged in an intense debate on which sort of incestuous marriage is the best. Though all are, of course, holy and great deeds any [Root.Religion.GetName] believer can do, there are certainly good points and bad points for each type. You decide to get involved in the conversation - what do you think is the best kind of incestuous marriage?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.a;Siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.b;Not just any siblings, but twins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.c;Parent and child.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.d;Any incest is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_bs;Being closer in age, they are more likely to get along with one another and understand things from the other's perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_tw;Twins are more than brother and sister. They shared a womb, came into this world together, and thus belong together.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_pc;A child must understand the source of their origin, and the creator of life must grow closer to that which they created.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_all;Come on, why must we fight? This is the sort of bickering of fools that will cause unnecessary divisions between all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8051.desc;During the day, I tend to forget the stars. But at night, how they shine! Far away, I cannot reach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8051.a;But I still watch the stars, longing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8052.desc;Before me is an endless expanse of grass and the sunset sky colored in pastel shades of rose and gold. A single tree is all there exists. I sit under the tree, and the wind faintly whispers in my ear, singing of the joys and sorrows of the ancients. It gently sways the tree, and shadows of the branches and leaves dance over my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8052.a;I wake up from the dream, and feel at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.title;Through the Valleys;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.desc;When I fell asleep and traveled to the land of dreams, I found myself on a vast hill of the greenest grass, overlooking a great lake surrounding a mighty city. Below the hill was an ancient marble shrine, while behind me was a small cottage beside a forest, where birds whistled and the trees whispered comfort in my ear. I rested for a while before I decided to...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.a;Walk down the hill, to see the lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.b;See the shrine to pay my respects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.c;Explore the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.d;Enter the cottage and relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.title;Harvest Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.desc;I emerge from my residence early in the morning to travel to an important noble's residence some distance from here. Along the way, as the sun slowly crept upwards into the sky, I pass by several villages. Peasants scatter themselves in the fields, working with their crops, though they always stop to pay their respects to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.a;Good to see all is in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.b;Those commoners scare me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.c;I want to ask some of them about how things are going.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.title;King and Country;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.desc;I realize that there must have been many rulers who came before me, lesser lords and ladies, as well as mighty kings and queens, who once ruled this country. Many of them I will never know. Will I, too, be forgotten one day, not even a footnote in a history book nor even a faint whisper in the wind?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.a;Even if I die, what matters is if I did my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.b;I will do great deeds to ensure my immortality!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.c;As long as I'm happy, then I am fine with whatever happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.d;Nothing matters in the end. Why do I even try?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.title;Wings of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.desc;I am in another dream again - this time, I am flying in the sky, looking over a realm of grassy pastures and green forests. There are so many places I can go to, yet one place calls to me, one place where I can't resist exploring:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.a;The pale, white temple to the north;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.b;The cosmopolitan trade port to the west;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.c;The mysterious, dark swamp to the south;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.d;The vast flower fields to the east;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.title;All's Well;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.desc;Today was a very quiet and boring day at court. Nothing exciting happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.a;Excitement isn't always desirable, so I'm glad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.b;I want excitement! I want to live life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_alls_well_type_b;\nPeople always say they want excitement in their lives, but they should wish for good things first - after all, excitement isn't always good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_alls_well_type_a;\nIndeed, sometimes people always sit around and don't do anything with their lives. What's the purpose of living if you don't explore the world?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.title;Watchman's Ease;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.desc;"Top of the morning and nothing to report," the guard told me as I made a few rounds around my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.a;Continue as you were.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.b;Stand up straight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.c;Why aren't you being more vigilant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.title;Glory of [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.desc;There are of course always those who doubt my right to rule this land and claim I am not a rightful [Root.GetTitle]. Yet how can I gaze upon this land of mine, and not see my connection to it? It is my realm too. I have a purpose as its master:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.a;To.... Actually, I'm not too sure if I have a purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.b;To do with it as I please.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.c;To protect and help my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.d;To bring glory to my realm and dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.title;Minstrel's Lament;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.desc;A musician I hired for a banquet sings a rather sad song. Many in my court are moved deeply by the pathos of the story being told.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.a;I, too, shed a tear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.b;I didn't find it that sad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.title;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s Ascension;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.desc;A physical manifestation of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] supposedly appeared in a remote village in [Root.GetName], and blessed a few locals, before ascending into the heavens. Few of the official clergy seem to believe these peasants' claims, saying it is misunderstandings of the ignorant, but the peasants don't care and have built altars where these incidents occurred.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.a;A good omen! Encourage the clergy to support the village.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.b;It was clearly an illusion of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. Repress the cult!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.c;I have no opinion on these peasants' superstitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.title;Dusk at the Market;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.desc;I rushed to the local market as the sun was setting, hoping to buy something I really wanted, but the merchant told me he had all run out of that product. "It will be a long time before I can acquire more of it," he told me apologetically, and even if I were to pay him a lot of money, he won't be able to get it for me right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.a;No problem with that! I will wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.b;That bastard! He's tricking me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.c;At least he's honest. Can't do much now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.title;Sunrise of Flutes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.desc;Today I woke up earlier than usual. Feeling a bit restless, I ventured out of my residence and took a walk outside with some trusted guards. We thought we heard a whistling sound up ahead, and upon further investigation we found out that it was a young shepherd with his flock, playing a pleasant song on his wooden flute. He greeted me reverently, and wished me the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.a;Please, play some more music. It's good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.b;He's just a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.title;Peace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.desc;There are those who say that according to the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] wants all peoples to be at peace with one another. But is that just mere idealism? Can true peace under the wisdom and benevolence of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] ever be accomplished?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.a;I think [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] wants us to smite infidels, not to have peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.b;Love and peace! We are indeed all brothers and sisters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.c;It's a nice idea, but idealism can only do so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8065.desc;In your dreams you find yourself a soldier in a world torn asunder. Ash and smoke fill the skies as you stand in a muddy trench, wearing outlandishly shaped, long robes. You glance around and see other men dressed the same way, and conclude this is a uniform of some sort. Nearby, you hear loud noises, like as if thousands of buildings were collapsing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8065.a;You cover your ears and close your eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8066.tooltip;It doesn't really help much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8066.title;No Man's Land;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8066.desc;Fearfully, you glance over the trench and see nothing but black mud at first. On the ground from one end of the horizon to another are stone-cold corpses with open eyes and still-bleeding wounds. Suddenly, another loud crash, this one closer.\n\nAs men around you begin to shout words you don't know, you see other soldiers grasping their weapons, which are strange, hollowed spears with crooked handles. You do understand, despite your terrified state, that you are to go over the muddy trench you are currently in and charge at some enemy on the other side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8066.a;You grasp your hollow spear and follow the others over the trench.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8067.tooltip;Wait, what was that? Ahhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8067.title;A World at War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8067.desc;You scream as you see metallic horses and birds the size of houses swoop around you, while loud explosions rock everywhere. Men fall down like paper burned by a never-ending inferno, from flying pebbles that tear them to pieces. Others are blown to pieces as thunder strikes seemingly arbitrary places on the ground.\n\nThis is the past of humanity, you realize: there is no future, no hope. This is the war to end all wars, that the world shall end in an apocalypse of fire and hatred.\n\nYou wake up, sweating. Was that a vision of the Event? Maybe. Will your descendants witness such horrors again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8067.a;I lie back down and try to sleep, but can't.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8068.desc;There have been manyempires, some quite large and some quite small. But today I have met an elderly wise woman and self-proclaimed seer who says we have yet to see the greatest of these empires. She says in the not too distant future, a great conqueror shall come across the sea and destroy all the kingdoms and empires in his path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8068.a;As if that'd happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8069.tooltip;There are lots of peoples who come and go, what would make this one any different?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8069.title;Scourge of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8069.desc;This lord shall be born grasping a blood clot in his fist, she proclaims, and his mighty warriors shall pour forth from the sea like water flows down a river and wash the world in blood and death.\n\nShe laughs at my doubt, and says in a chilling tone: "He is not to be trifled with, for he is the very fist of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] to punish all for their wickedness. By his arrows, the Ghosts of the North shall perish. Under the hooves of his riders, the Southern Knights shall fall one by one. Against his dark armor, forged from the very sins of mankind, even the fearsome Sword of Islam and the Crusader Kings will do naught but a scratch to this bloodied messenger of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8069.a;Ha! The Ghosts of the North cannot possibly fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8069.b;The Southern Knights can fight such a monster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8069.c;He sounds scary, but the Sword of Islam is stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8069.d;Surely the Crusader Kings will have the zeal to resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8070.desc;I am asleep and wandering the void before my mind is pulled into a dream. Deep in my subconsciousness, I know this as a vision of the future, though my consciousness doesn't register it as such. There is a fork at the road - at least, I think it is a road, and I think it is a fork at a road - that goes in two directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8070.a;Left;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8070.b;Right;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8071.desc;I see nothing but fire and brimstone. Gone is all hope! Gone is the future of my dynasty and my realm! All has been destroyed by our enemies and the will of the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8071.a;Is this our fate? It can't be!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8071.b;This is a sign that I must reform myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8072.desc;I see an idyllic landscape as far as the horizon stretches. The sky is bright, the sun is warm, the birds are singing. In this world, my dynasty and my realm prosper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8072.a;It would be good if this came true.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8072.b;This is but one possible future. I must be cautious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8073.desc;A traveling seer is visiting my court today. She is a strange one, sometimes staring into space and saying nothing in the middle of a chat, other times speaking in tongues. But when given some food, she seems to enter a trance. We all watch her, uncertain. It begins with some undecipherable mumbles, but soon becomes comprehensible speech.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8073.a;What is... what is she saying?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8074.tooltip;We all listen closely to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8074.desc;The seer's words are a chilling prophecy: "A holy fury from the Sons of Abraham shall descend into our land and kill the old gods." She continues, ranting about how our ancient ways are in grave danger before collapsing and falling asleep. When she wakes up, she doesn't recall anything she said.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8074.a;That was a lunatic's rant - the old gods are strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8074.b;We must prepare to protect ourselves from this holy fury!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8074.c;The Sons of Abraham are mighty, this is simply our fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8075.desc;In [Root.GetName], a charismatic monk has become leader of a cult and claiming to be an incarnation of Maitreya, the Buddha who would come at the end of this aeon, when the true authentic teachings are no longer practiced. His cult is small, and most, including many clergy, have dismissed him as a charlatan and troublemaker. Yet his followers are fanatical and have already committed some criminal acts. By chance, he was arrested and brought before you for judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8075.a;Imprison him and repress the cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8075.b;Execute him and repress the cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8075.c;Let him go, he has not done anything serious yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8075.d;Host a public debate with some real monks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_maitreya_cult_imprison;We cannot make him a martyr. Imprisonment works better and it will make us look merciful.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_maitreya_cult_execute;He is too dangerous, and must be made an example of. Some of his followers will think he is still alive, but they will be few.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_maitreya_cult_release;There are many heretics and frauds claiming to be Buddhas. This man is no different, so why should I care?\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_maitreya_cult_debate;His cult will lose even more power and influence if the people can see legitimate masters argue effectively against him.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8076.desc;You thought he was a beggar screaming nonsense at first. When you asked some locals however, they explained he was actually a deranged lunatic who believed the end times were coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8076.a;Ah, yes, so the usual sort. Carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8076.b;Why, the end of the world IS coming soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8077.desc;You had a nightmare that began innocently. At first, you were talking to a beautiful young lady, who seemed most charming, but she transformed into the Whore of Babylon herself, and brought with her fire and death. She laughed as you tried to run away, before screaming in a shrill, demented voice that you nor you realm would escape a terrible fate!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8077.a;I awoke, frightened beyond my wits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8078.desc;We were having a good meal when someone pointed out that [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetTitledName] always eats [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetHerHis] food too quickly. "Be careful! What if you accidentally choke on your food one day?"\n\n[target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetTitledName] laughs and dismisses the warning.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8078.a;It's [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetHerHis] problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8078.b;Do be careful, [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8078.c;I'll persuade [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetTitledName] to eat more slowly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8079.desc;It was a quiet dinner, until [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetTitledName] began to choke on [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetHerHis] food! [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetSheHe] didn't heed the warnings at all!\n\nPeople rush over, trying to help [target_VIET_choking_warning_courtier.GetTitledName], and the situation grows chaotic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8079.a;"AAAWWWCCKKKK - ";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8080.desc;I wonder if people in the past had the same sort of desires and thoughts I do. I then wonder if people in the future will be the same as me as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8080.a;Definitely! At the end of the day we are all people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8080.b;No, people of the past and future are too different from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8081.desc;Lately, I have been thinking about what I want to do when I grow up. Being a kid is so boring! I can't wait to grow up so I can...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8081.a;See the world and fight bad guys;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8081.b;Do the things grown-ups tell me not to do;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8081.c;Be a good [Root.GetBoyGirl] and not make trouble;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8081.d;Learn how to become a wise and great [Root.GetTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8082.desc;For some reason you wake up about an hour or so before you do. You just can't go back to sleep and the sun is already rising above the horizon. Though you feel a little tired, perhaps you can take the opportunity to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8082.a;Go outside and take a quick walk;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8082.b;Eat breakfast early;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8082.c;Lie in bed and stare at the ceiling;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8082.d;Read a book;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8083.desc;You are traveling and the sun is beating down on you heavily. However, it is too late to turn back home - you are getting closer to your destination, the mansion of a local noble you have to meet. Yet you are clearly getting more and more tired as the sun rises ever higher in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8083.a;Rest for a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8083.b;Continue on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8084.desc;I am watching a theatrical performance presented by the local Chinese community about Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, who is popular in China and even worshiped by some. An actor dressed as a monkey dances around on stage, giggling as he mocks his enemies and dodges their attacks, in his efforts to save his master, the famous Chinese monk and pilgrim Xuanzang.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8084.a;It is an interesting story!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8085.desc;Today the sky is clear, the bluest of colors. The sun shines high above with nary a cloud to cover it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8085.a;How bright!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8086.desc;[target_VIET_scorpion_victim.GetTitledName] was feeling a little tired today and, due to the glare of the sun, did not see the scorpion. [target_VIET_scorpion_victim.GetSheHe] stepped on the creature and it stung [target_VIET_scorpion_victim.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8086.a;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8087.desc;[Root.Religion.GetName] devotees often see stars as symbols of order and thus good, but the planets, even the sun and moon, with their irregular movements, are looked on with suspicion. Some clergy in my realm say we mustn't be too tolerant of foreign ideas that view these celestial bodies too positively. Others say these foreign ideas can provide us many intellectual boons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8087.a;Discourage learning from foreign astronomical ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8087.b;Remain neutral on the matter;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8087.c;Encourage learning from foreign astronomical ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8088.desc;The traveling merchant makes a convincing case. Sunburns and tans aren't just unattractive, they're also harmful and dangerous. He offers to sell me and my court a special oil mainly made from rice, jasmine, lupine, and other herbs that helps protect one when under the sun for too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8088.a;Deal! Who'd ever want a tan anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8088.b;Let's try to haggle a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8088.c;I think this is a waste of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8089.desc;One of your courtiers was moronic enough to stare at the sun for too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8089.a;Are you kidding me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8090.desc;While I was sitting still, I thought I saw my shadow move on its own, but I must've been seeing things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8090.a;I was probably seeing things. Right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8090.b;No! I saw something! Don't you see it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8091.desc;I am holding court one day and feeling extremely bored, so I start to watch the shadows of my courtiers as they talk or move around. It is interesting how these black shades move back and forth - or at least, much more interesting than whatever is going on right now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8091.a;Sorry, I missed that. Can you repeat what you just said?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8091.b;I can't let myself get distracted from more important matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8092.desc;You are inspecting some soldiers while they are drilling. Standing under the sun is very exhausting, and you feel as if you want to faint. You consider stepping back and sitting under the shade. On the other hand, that would make you look weak and unwilling to share the soldiers' burdens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8092.a;I am just so tired. I'll rest in the shade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8092.b;No! I must endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8093.desc;A village in [Root.GetName] has a giant tree that was planted many generations ago to provide shade for the locals. It has been something of a popular site for people to visit, and some in your court suggest you could donate some funds to assist in caring for the tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8093.a;A good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8093.b;There is no need to get involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8094.desc;Locals from [Root.GetName] have reported the most unusual and concerning incidents. Several sources have claimed that they have seen otherworldly shadows, vaguely in the shape of people, going around attempting to kill unsuspecting innocents. The common thread here is that the shadows tend to appear at night as people are falling asleep. Reputable scholars and clergy believe this is nothing but hysteria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8094.a;Troubling times we live in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8094.b;Send in clergy to pray. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] preserve us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8094.c;These commoners are making things up!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8094.d;The scholars are right - sleep terrors are nothing new.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8095.desc;I was walking along the main street of a local town when I saw a dark shadow quickly move towards me. I froze in place, unsure of how to respond, only to realize a moment later it was just an ordinary townsperson wearing an oversized black cloak. They disappeared into the crowd and I continued on my way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8095.a;Whew! Just a false alarm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8095.b;What a very suspicious person.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8096.title;Shadow of the Colossus;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8096.desc;While traveling through a part of my realm, I pass by a large rock formation. A local nobleman accompanying me says that according to the legends told by the inhabitants of this region, a giant once terrorized this region until [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] put an end to his tyranny by turning him into stone. They call this place the "Shadow of the Colossus.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8096.a;Huh. Now that is an interesting tale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8097.desc;I wake up in the middle of the night, but feel something heavy on my chest, and it is hard for me to breathe. I open my eyes slightly, and see what I think what is a shadow in a vaguely human shape on top of me. I try to scream, yet I find I cannot scream at all! Moments later, I wake up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8097.a;It was just a bad dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8097.b;I say a prayer to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8097.c;No... no... what if that shadow returns?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8098.desc;The other day, I found this secret trail nearby that led to a little lake. It was surrounded by many trees and one could easily fall asleep under their shade on one of the rocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8098.a;I should go here more often by myself to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8098.b;I want to invite people here - it's a good place to socialize!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8098.c;This is a great spot to spend with my lover privately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8099.desc;Today is unusually hot, but I have some time off. I'd like to go down to the beach to cool myself in the waters and relax under the shade of the palm trees. Perhaps I can even bring someone with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8099.a;I'll go by myself with a few guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8099.b;Bring my family with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8099.c;Perhaps I can get to know one of my courtiers better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8099.d;Why not go with my lover?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8100.desc;I awoke late at night, and had to go relieve myself. As I walked back from the chamber pot, it was very dark, and I could not see where I was going. I tripped and fell down, making much noise. Several guards on night duty rushed to my side, but thankfully I did not suffer any major injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8100.a;Might need a few stitches though.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8101.desc;In the past few months, a town in [Root.GetName] suffered from quite a scare. Locals heard strange, inhuman sounds at night, and feared [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] was up to something. Prayers were offered, officials increased nightly patrols, and so on. However, by chance, it has been discovered the source of all this were several crafty youths who, with nothing better to do, pranked the town at everyone else's expense. The boys are under arrest and their fate is now in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8101.a;No harm done, let them go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8101.b;They will be subject to public humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8101.c;Imprison them for the crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8101.d;Execute them. No mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8102.desc;It has recently come to my attention that a local astronomer has been hard at work developing some star charts to map the heavens. He has graciously given me one of them as a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8102.a;How kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8102.b;He can keep it for himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8103.desc;The wind is howling loudly tonight, keeping me awake. It's scary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8103.a;Hide behind my covers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8103.b;It's just noise!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8103.c;Is that [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]? I'll pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8103.d;I want to see what it looks like outside!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8104.desc;I wake up in the middle of the night, feeling hungry. Perhaps I should go get a quick midnight snack?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8104.a;I'll go get it myself;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8104.b;I will call a servant;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8104.c;Maybe I should not;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8104.d;I want to watch the stars;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8105.desc;Because it is so dark at night, while trying to get into bed you accidentally knocked some things over, waking up a few servants, who scurry outside, wondering what all the commotion is about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8105.a;Now everyone knows what a clumsy oaf I am!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8106.desc;Over the past few months, unexplained apparitions have appeared in several areas in [Root.GetName] after sunset, frightening the locals. Suddenly, in the past week or so, however, these ghostly figures have disappeared. Ironically, this frightens the people living here even more, as no one knows if this is an omen of something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8106.a;Dark and troubling news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8106.b;I don't find this scary at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8106.c;The so-called ghosts are gone now, we should be happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8107.desc;There have been reports of some sort of demoness, a succubus, active in parts of [Root.GetName]. According to a number of men, and even a few women, this hauntingly beautiful creature attacks them at night by paralyzing them before fornicating with them in the most pleasurable yet sinful ways imaginable. The fact that most of the victims describe the demoness' similarly suggests this might not be a mere bout of hysteria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8107.a;Disturbing, but it's probably nothing, I'm sure of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8107.b;Send in clergy and scholars to help ward off this evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8107.c;I wish I could experience such forbidden pleasures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8107.d;It's just a case of many common sleep terrors happening coincidentally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8108.desc;I lie down in bed and pull my blanket over me and it brushes my chin. I wonder to myself whether I should have the blanket over my chin, or under it. I try both, switching between one or another, but neither feels proper. Eventually I settle on...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8108.a;Over my chin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8108.b;Under my chin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8109.desc;You were eating a small snack before going to bed, but did not want others to notice you, so you ate it in the darkness. However, this turned out to be a mistake, as you could not see what you were eating. Something must've been lodged in that food, for you began to choke...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8109.a;AGGGKKHHGGHHHH -;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8110.desc;Before I go to bed I gaze at the night sky, and can make out a few of the constellations. How lovely they are, artworks dancing in the sky!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8110.a;And over there is the Big Dipper...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8111.desc;For the last week or two, I've found myself unable to fall asleep quickly. A few of my courtiers said there is a local herbalist who currently has a large stock of the herb valerian, which she has successfully used to treat several cases of insomnia. Drinking this valerian tea may be just what I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8111.a;Yes, I will purchase some.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8111.b;No! I'm fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8112.desc;Lately, several incidents of grave robbing have been reported in a nearby cemetery. The grave robbers strike at night, when few are awake, and no one has been able to catch them yet. Perhaps if you were to dedicate a few soldiers to patrol the location, the criminals could be caught eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8112.a;Let's do that. This travesty cannot continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8112.b;No, it would be a waste of resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8113.tooltip; \n\nThese wrongdoers will face justice soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8113.title;Grave Robbers Caught;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8113.desc;Your trusty guards caught the grave robbers after only a few nights, as the robbers made a mistake - they dug what they thought was a grave, but it turned out to be a cache of ancient goods! They made a lot of noise, knocking down several ancient clay pots, and alerting your men.\n\nAfter you punished the criminals accordingly and awarded your men for their efforts, you now have to decide what to do with the cache of ancient goods. Most of them are worn out or broken, and will only be of interest to antiquarians and scholars, but one object remains in good condition: a lovely ancient pot, with intricate designs and decorations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8113.a;This would make a nice decoration, wouldn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8114.desc;One of my young servants has always been a daredevil. A friend challenged him to swim in a dangerous part of the beach at night. For once, my servant hesitated, but his friend told him that to be afraid of the danger meant he was a weakling with no ambitions in life, who was just content to sit around. Of course, he did the dare, and drowned as none could see him in the darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8114.a;This is a tragedy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8114.b;Ha! Weakling!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8114.c;Imprison his "friend"!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8115.desc;You decided to see the beach at night out of curiosity, and was rewarded with a wonderful sight: the lovely moon, dancing around the stars, reflected on the ocean waves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8115.a;I'm glad I came here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8116.desc;While hunting we recently killed a wolf. Its fur was quite luxurious, unlike any other wolf! We should make a pelt out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8116.a;I will decorate one of my rooms with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8116.b;This isn't necessary for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8117.desc;The silversmith said he was willing to sell you a fine set of silverware for a good price. Judging by how luxurious the set looks, this seems like a great deal! However, as some in your court have pointed out, do you really need more symbols of your wealth and influence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8117.a;Why not? I'm not vain - I just like nice things!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8117.b;They're not wrong. I already have enough tableware.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8118.desc;The merchant hands me the colorful quill pen, and explains it was made using the feather of an exotic, rare, mythical bird that lives in the legendary tropical island of so-and-so. It is even said this bird has gone extinct, so if I want to buy this quill, I will have to pay a hefty price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8118.a;I can afford such a fine quill.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8118.b;On second thought, I'm not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8119.desc;I've grown fond of one of the goblets I use to drink beverages during my meals. Since I'm so attached to it, perhaps I should just keep it with me and use it from now on, instead of other goblets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8119.a;Yes! It will be my special goblet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8119.b;Getting obsessed with one goblet is weird.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8120.desc;You are presented with a gift of a lovely pitcher by some local nobles stopping by to pay a visit. You politely thank them and resume business. Afterwards, you take some time to examine the pitcher. It is definitely a higher quality one, with unique engravings and decorations on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8120.a;Keep it around for important occasions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8120.b;Throw it somewhere. It's not that special.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8121.desc;Bravo, bravo! The bard you hired played most beautifully. After the performance, you talk with him and the conversation drifts to the topic of his lutes, which are quite ornate and lovely to look at. He says he has one lute he doesn't play with anymore, finding it unsatisfactory. When he shows it to you, you're impressed with its appearance, and he says he can sell it to you for a low price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8121.a;I'll buy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8121.b;I'll convince him to sell it for less.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8121.c;I can haggle for a lower price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8121.d;That's fine, I'm not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8122.desc;Many claim the local locksmith can make a lock so hard to open, no one will ever lockpick it. Since many people vouch for this man, you consider asking him to design a special chest for you. Whether it's valuables, incriminating letters, or precious mementos, it will keep anything safe - as long as you have the key, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8122.a;I will order one to my specifications.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8122.b;I have nothing to hide, so I don't need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8123.desc;There is a glassmith living nearby who can make glass that is very clear, an extremely difficult feat to achieve. You consider buying a hand mirror made by this fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8123.a;I can afford to buy this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8123.b;My current mirrors are poorer quality but I'm fine with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8124.desc;Chess is a popular game nowadays. Even if I don't play it much, it might be worth it to invest in commissioning an artisan to fashion a quality chess set for me in case I ever need it, if only to present myself as a modern, sociable leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8124.a;Let's go find ourselves that chess set!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8124.b;This is a waste of my money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8125.desc;A local scholar recently returned from his travels abroad, and you invited him over to share stories of all he saw and recorded. He shows you some porcelain chopsticks he received from a friend he made there. He says he wishes to present them to you as a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8125.a;Thanks! My old chopsticks are so drab and wretched by comparison.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8125.b;Thanks! I don't know how to use them, but they can be decoration somewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8125.c;No thanks, I'm fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8126.desc;Playing dice is often associated with the lower classes, gamblers, criminals, and those of little consequence, but even the upper echelons of society enjoy some good dice games. Lately, I've been interested in them, and an acquaintance of mine says they have a spare pair of dice - of lovely appearance, fit for a person of high station like me - they can lend me if I ever need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8126.a;Sure, why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8126.b;It's okay, I don't think dice games are my sort of thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8127.desc;My feet feel so sore, tired, and outright miserable lately. I've thought about buying some silk slippers to walk around in when in my private quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8127.a;Yes! That's a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8127.b;No, no. That's too extravagant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8128.desc;The nearby land sometimes produces some fascinating finds. While walking back home one day, I saw something odd sticking out of the ground. I and my guards unearthed what scholars call an ostracon, an ancient pottery shard with inscriptions on it. This ostracon's inscriptions look crude, but it could make for a nice decoration in my residence to show how intellectual I am....;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8128.a;Yes, let's put it up somewhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8128.b;I will donate it to some local scholars for study.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8128.c;It could be filled with ancient, evil curses! Destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8129.desc;You come across a farmer who has a scarecrow with a most curious appearance: it is an ancient terracotta sculpture he found buried in the ground a year or two ago. The clay figurine depicts a person, with an elongated and stylized face, wearing jewels and ornaments. It is smooth and beautifully made, and it would be a shame to let it remain a scarecrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8129.a;The farmer looks happy with it;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8129.b;Buy it from the farmer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8129.c;Force the farmer to hand it over;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8129.d;Persuade the farmer to give it for free;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8130.desc;A clay tablet was recently found by one of your servants, stashed in a nearby cave. Such a discovery is rare but not unheard of - occasionally people stumble on entire caches of these, though this one is particularly well-preserved. For centuries, the wisest scholars of the region have attempted to decipher this ancient writing, which appears like little wedges, to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8130.a;Keep the tablet for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8130.b;Give it to a scholar - it'll be of more use that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8130.c;Throw it away, I don't care about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8130.d;My servant can keep it, as he found it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8131.desc;According to Confederacy records, in ancient times, the people dwelling where we are now were said to be uncivilized barbarians. It is certain a good number of the local leadership are descended from such people, so having such barbarian ancestors must be a stain on their honor and pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8131.a;We have learned much and are no longer savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8131.b;We were never barbarians to begin with - those are lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8131.c;We aren't related to those barbarians! My family's roots lie elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8131.d;Confederates were just as merciless and vile as the barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8132.desc;I got lost and stumbled on what appeared to be an ancient graveyard or burial tomb. With much trepidation I tried to leave quickly as to not disturb the dead, when I fell into a hole and found myself face to face with a mummy! The mummy appeared to be of some woman, and it stared back at me with its empty  eye sockets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8132.a;"My apologies for disturbing! I am lost.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8132.b;Quietly get out and find my way home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8132.c;"Ha! I'm not scared of some dead body.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8133.desc;Eventually my guards found me and brought me home. Later that night, I dreamt that I was visited by a beautiful young lady, wearing black, and whose appearance seemed familiar. Her eyes were red with fury, her mouth a menacing grin that showed fanged teeth, and I felt a chill down my spine. "How dare you insult me, you worm! Do you know who I am? I am the ancient princess of these lands! I curse you for your insolence!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8133.a;I woke up, feeling strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8134.desc;Eventually my guards found me and brought me home. Later that night, I dreamt that I was visited by a beautiful young lady, wearing white, and whose appearance seemed familiar. Her doe eyes were soft, her mouth curled into a gentle smile, and I felt a sense of utmost comfort. "Do not fear. You are a good person. Few would speak with a mummy so kindly - I am the spirit of that mummy you met earlier, the ancient princess of these lands, and I give you my blessings.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8134.a;I woke up, feeling relaxed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8135.desc;As part of your official duties, you are meeting a group of scholars from a particular part of your realm. They take you and your entourage on a trip to a nearby ruins. The leader among them begins to explain the history of these ruins and who made them, but this stuffy academic has a rather dry and boring manner of speaking, and you find yourself falling asleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8135.a;I'll take a nap - I'm the [Root.GetTitle], they won't protest!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8136.desc;An ancient marble statue of a man was discovered buried in the wilderness. According to various scholars' assertions, it was perhaps made before the Event. Regardless, perhaps you would like to keep this statue for yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8136.a;Those chiseled muscles... I like them....;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8136.b;I am not interested in keeping this false idol!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8136.c;It'd be a fitting decoration in one of my rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8140.desc;High in a mountainous part of your realm, there are ancient ruins built of rock and stone. Perhaps it was once a shrine, or someone's house, or an ancient fortress. Though much of it has fallen apart, some of it is still remarkably preserved and recently, these ruins have become increasingly popular among shepherds, trade caravans, and other travelers as a resting location, and there are proposals to improve it by building an inn. Besides the inn, we can also build...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8140.a;Never mind. We don't have the resources at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8140.b;A house of worship for the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8140.c;An additional wing for the inn.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8140.d;A military outpost to protect the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8141.desc;While on patrol recently in the mountains, a few of your soldiers got lost. Miraculously, they all survived with no major injuries. What more, they stumbled on an ancient cache buried deep in a small mountain shrine that must have been untouched for centuries, if not longer. They present their findings to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8141.a;Excellent, excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8141.b;Split some of it with the soldiers - that's only fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8141.c;Let the soldiers have it all, for they found it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8142.desc;I am sightseeing a part of my realm today. Having journeyed far, I and several of my companions are weary and tired. We spot some ruins in the distance. They are decrepit, but enough for us to rest in. I make myself comfortable, leaning a smooth, carved stone, and as I fall asleep I mutter to myself:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8142.a;What an impressive sight this place must have been...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8143.title;It Was Beautiful;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8143.desc;A man I do not recognize approaches me. "It was an impressive sight," he tells me with authority. "It was, many centuries ago, when it was my home."\n\nI ask him, "You lived here?"\n\nSuddenly, the landscape before me changes! The ruins disappear, and instead I see a magnificent building in a style I do not recognize, surrounded by a spectacular landscape. The man gestures, and answers, "I did, and it was beautiful."\n\nI admire the scenery for some time, before I gradually wake up and find myself back in the ruins.

VIETmisc.8144.desc;"By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! A handsome man in our town at last!" the barmaid says, blushing and smiling as you enter the tavern.

One of his children, a charming [Root.GetBoyGirlOpp], tries to make small talk with me, and coyly says, "It's a fine day with you around...." This [Root.GetBoyGirlOpp] is clearly inexperienced at conversing with [Root.GetHerHisOpp] betters, but it is endearing.

Though not too old, she bears a number of battle wounds, and her demeanor suggests she is tough as nails. She tells me, if a bit ominously, "Death is my art, and like all artists, I seek a patron. For a mere handful of gold, I will follow you into any danger.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8146.a;She's an unconventional sort, but hire her anyways!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8146.c;Hah! A woman thinks she can actually fight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8147.desc;I am visiting some of the peasants nearby, to better gauge how things are going in my realm, or at least to pretend I care.

VIETmisc.8148.desc;The village market is always a bustling place. While waiting for someone, I idly watch people. From earnest farmers selling and buying produce to crafty merchants from exotic lands, there are so many here. I notice there is a little girl working at the stall next to me, so I ask her what she is doing here. "I sell fruits and vegetables with my mother. It's fun most days but hard work.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8148.a;Better get used to a life of hard work, kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8150.desc;In the hills of [Root.Capital.GetName], there are some mining operations that bring in much needed profit to the local towns. While visiting one such mining town I learn about its most peculiar arrangement. The town's two mines are owned by a married couple, except they are business rivals. Thus, husband and wife each own one mine and compete against each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8150.a;The townsfolk say they constantly bicker.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8151.tooltip;How are they still married?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8151.desc;Somehow, years ago, the husband and wife had a falling out, and are now trying to drive each other out of business. This absurd situation confounds and troubles the townspeople, but given the profits the mines bring in, they decide to live with it. Now, however, with my coming, the husband and wife demand that I support one of them in favor of the other. On one hand, there is no legal need for me to get involved in their bizarre squabble. On the other hand, it's clear the husband and wife still care about each other and they're just too proud to believe otherwise, not to mention I could gain some sort of financial benefit from this too by getting a good business deal with one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8151.a;The husband seems more reliable than his shrewish wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8151.b;The wife seems sharper than her oafish husband.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8152.desc;A maid is helping me clean out my room. She is infamous for having a sarcastic and occasionally absent-minded personality, even if she is quite capable and undyingly loyal.

VIETmisc.8211.desc;It took years, but we've finally captured one of the most notorious bandits in the region. When he is brought before me, he admits to being an "obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters." He shrugs off any threat of torture and death, saying this isn't the first time he's caught by the authorities, and that he'd take it as a personal insult if no one wanted him dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8221.desc;Somewhere, in the far reaches of my subconscious, I know that I am in a dream, but I otherwise do not remember who I truly am.

VIETmisc.8228.desc;I wander a field of blurry yet vivid colors, and cannot tell what is above and what is below, what is left and what is right. I am simultaneously floating driftlessly and walking aimlessly. Am I in the primordial churning ocean, or the primeval endless skies? Somewhere deep within myself, though I cannot articulate it, I know that this is the era of dreams, when people could not distinguish between conscious and subconscious, when we walked the dreamscape of the universe under the benevolent watch of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8229.a;Outside, the sun is rising.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8230.desc;A quiet campfire burns besides me as I sit down. I have been traveling for aeons in this strange dream of mine. Where am I going, and where have I gone? I know not. It is night, and around me is desert sand, yet I feel neither cold nor hot. The skies above fade in and out of different, unnatural colors such as dark emerald, maroon, or the blue of the ocean's depths. I lie back and watch the flickering stars. How beautiful this world is!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8230.a;I fall asleep within my dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8231.desc;I wake up with a jolt. Am I back in reality? Or in that dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8231.d;Or am I in another dream within a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8232.desc;The sky is like waves of red and yellow and dark pink, as the sun slowly wades itself deeper and deeper into the horizon. "Isn't it lovely?" my companion asks. I don't disagree.\n\nSuddenly, I begin to wake up. What a beautiful sunset I saw in my dream!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8232.a;But who was my mysterious companion?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8233.desc;There is nothing but a river that goes forever, surrounded by the green grass and lush trees and bushes. If I wander too far, I find myself back at the river, somehow. Above the sky is pale blue, and a gentle breeze whispers past me. And so, on and on I go, along the primordial, endless river. Even when I wake up, and try to recall my dream, it doesn't make sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8233.a;How can a river be shaped like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8234.desc;I stand on a stage, but one unlike any other I've ever seen before. It is immense in size, more like the throne room of a faraway Emperor. There are bright lights high above, a hundred suns that blind me to the audience below. But even in this dream, I know that I must perform music here. Yet I cannot play. My dream self remembers a painful memory from the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8234.a;I sorrowfully watch my instrument.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8235.a;After waking up, I can still hear the song I played in my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8236.desc;I am lost in a maze of tunnels that never seem to end. No matter where I turn, right or left, I cannot find a way out. No matter where I go, there is no one here. I thought there might have been monsters or bandits lurking about, but my only friends and enemies are the flickers of the occasional torch and the cold stone walls. Nothing exists but the dark passageways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8236.a;I wake up, sweating, with a feeling of unease.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8237.desc;I wander a field that stretches from horizon to horizon, lost. I travel for what seems like years upon years and find no sense of direction, and I grow scared. I beg for some respite. Suddenly, on the horizon, I see something approaching me - a woman dressed in an ethereal dress like clouds in the sky, atop a pale horse. She gazes at me with a neutral expression, and I ask her where I am, and where is the nearest town. She does not speak, but merely points in a certain direction, before riding off and disappearing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8237.a;I follow her directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8238.desc;Some time later - I do not know how long - the faint image of a village appears. Hurrah! It is just as that mysterious woman pointed to me!\n\nAs I wake up from my strange dream, I can only think of one thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8238.a;Who was that lady?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8239.desc;He wanders the universe atop his mighty steed, aimlessly, as far as our mortal minds can comprehend. Finally, I meet this figure in my dream, whose appearance and purpose I cannot truly grasp. When I talk or gesture to him, all he does is nod sagely and point towards something far away. I try to reach towards the destination he indicated, but before I arrive, I wake up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8239.a;Who was that man, and where did he tell me to go?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8240.desc;There is a very small but thriving group of Chinese shoemakers living nearby. They ask for your support to help them build a small shrine to the ancient Chinese warlord Liu Bei, who, despite being a distant scion of the Han Dynasty, had humble beginnings as a shoemaker.

VIETmisc.8240.a;Good luck with that. I'm sure you don't need my help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8240.b;I can provide a bit of monetary aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8241.desc;I recently provided protection to a small group of Chinese envoys and travelers in my territory. During their journey, they were attacked by ruthless bandits, but my brave men held them off. In gratitude, one my Chinese guests offered a colorful statue of Guan Yu that is an old family heirloom.

After he performs it for you, he asks what you think.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8242.a;That was bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8242.b;Very good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8242.c;I like it so much, I'll offer him a place at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8243.desc;You meet a wanderer from a land far away, who recently traveled to the far east.

VIETmisc.8244.desc;Lately, I have been reading about the heroes and villains of the Three Kingdoms, that era of disunity and conflict in China when the Han Dynasty collapsed into civil war. For centuries, people have told many stories, some more fantastical than others, about the deeds and exploits of this fascinating cast of characters. I in particular have an admiration for the...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8244.b;Generals who bravely fought on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8244.c;Strategists who determined the fates of many.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8244.d;Noblewomen who were influential in their own ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8245.desc;"The Empire, once united, must divide. Once divided, must unite." Thus had it always been with Chinese history. In that era of disunity, the Three Kingdoms, plenty of powerful, ambitious leaders sought to reunite China, some virtuous, some unscrupulous. There is one in particular I find very inspiring:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8245.a;Cao Cao - cunning and cultured;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8245.b;Liu Bei - just and benevolent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8245.c;Sun Quan - hardworking and proud;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8245.d;Dong Zhuo - tyrannical and merciless;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8246.desc;Many are the names of the generals from the Three Kingdoms period. Whether with blade or spear or halberd or bow, whether on foot or on horseback, it was these men's daring and courage that determined the course of battles - and the course of history.

VIETmisc.8246.a;Righteous Guan Yu, who became a God of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8246.b;Fiery Zhang Fei, deathly loyal to Liu Bei's cause;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8246.c;One-eyed Xiahou Dun, humble soldier of Cao Cao;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8246.d;Ruthless Lu Bu, the treacherous but unmatched Flying General;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8247.desc;The strategists, through their manipulations and complex mind games, are the ones who truly hold the power to shape the course of history. Whether it is choosing battle tactics or contemplating administrative policies, they left their mark on the turbulent times of the Three Kingdoms. My favorite is:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8247.a;Zhuge Liang, the peerless sleeping dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8247.b;Sima Yi, the calculating politician;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8247.c;Zhou Yu, the cultured youth;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8247.d;Chen Gong, the doomed gentleman;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8248.desc;Though it was usually men who fought each other in the arenas of battle and politics during the age of the Three Kingdoms, many women also fought in their own ways as well.

VIETmisc.8248.a;Diaochan, who sacrificed herself for a nation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8248.b;Sun Shangxiang, courageous and skilled in the martial arts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8248.c;Qiao sisters, the two charming and talented beauties;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8256.desc;An acquaintance tells me that she heard if one digs underground deep enough, one will emerge in another world where there are people similar to ours. However, they are the opposite of us - their women are taller than their men, the men stay at home and manage domestic affairs while the women fight wars, and most scandalously, siblings can wed one another. Still, my acquaintance said she heard this land was mostly peaceful and prosperous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8256.a;Perhaps their strange ways are why they're prosperous and peaceful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8256.b;Really now! What kind of society like that could exist?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8256.c;How exciting! My imagination is trying to envision such a place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8257.desc;Someone tells me of a king in a faraway land who was cruel, yet fair in his dealings. Once, he hired an engineer to create the largest labyrinth the world has ever known. Those guilty of the worst crimes are put in this maze of tunnels and hallways. Almost none escape, but there are always a few who have the wits and tenacity, and the king grants these few their freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8257.a;Someone capable enough to escape deserves freedom, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8257.b;A strange ruler! Such unnecessary and outlandish methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8257.c;I hope his labyrinth is full of monsters and death traps!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8258.desc;I have heard rumors about a noble and valiant warrior woman in a distant land, who is immortal and stands guard over an ancient gate made of marble and obsidian. Those who best her in combat will be allowed into the gate, which is a portal to a heavenly paradise, a most peaceful and pastoral landscape one can live in with no worries nor fears. If it did exist, could I go there?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8258.a;If only I could go to such a place, I'd be so happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8258.b;I'm sure I could beat that woman and gain entry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8258.c;I don't need it. I have all I need here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8259.desc;I meet a local village elder, a wizened old man, who was a foolhardy adventurer in his youth. He once got lost in a great forest, and almost drowned in its swamps. He was rescued by a mysterious man who referred to himself only as a dreamer and who warned about the seductive dangers of excitement and risk. Afterwards, the old man lived a stable, quiet, happy life back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8259.a;Agreed! Only idiots blindly worship excitement and ambition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8259.b;I disagree. What's the point of living a boring life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8259.c;Wait a moment... did you meet the Dreamer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8260.desc;Among the nomad peoples of America, there are stories of an immortal horse, forever racing across the great steppes, free and bold. The galloping of the mighty steed's hooves sound like thunder, and it is faster than anything one could see.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8260.a;Maybe one day I shall see it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8260.b;A fanciful tale, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8261.desc;I have a guard who once visited a distant village by a forest said to be a gateway to the world beyond. He went in the forest despite the locals' warning. There, he encountered a pale maiden wearing a white dress. Though she was charming and bashful, he fled immediately, knowing this must have been a frightening spirit of some sort. The locals said such sightings are common.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8261.a;What a coward! She couldn't have been a spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8261.b;Frightening things lie beyond the fringes of civilization!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8262.desc;My new maid is a strange woman. Her father was a merchant, and she accompanied him on his journeys. She claims when she was little, they visited a forested land when she got lost in the woods at night. A mysterious woman found her sobbing, and guided her back to the main road. The woman barely spoke and merely said she was a dreamer, and disappeared soon after.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8262.a;A strange encounter!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8262.b;Wait - you met the Dreamer, didn't you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8263.desc;I am hosting a prominent local scholar. Contrary to my expectations of him being an awkward, doddering old man, he is rather young, handsome, and charismatic. As we talk, he tells me about a large lake in my realm. He once visited it, but almost drowned when he tried taking a swim. When he came to, he found himself on one of the lake's islands he never saw before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8263.a;What happened next?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8264.tooltip;He describes its geography, and I do not recall a lake on such an island either. Very mysterious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8264.title;Lost Island;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8264.desc;The scholar circled the shore of the island and came across an old temple built by the ancients, yet still in good condition despite being abandoned. There, he quickly prayed to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. Afterwards, to his surprise, he found a small boat near the temple which he used to leave the island.\n\nEvery time he returned to the lake, he could never find the island again. No one has heard of an island on that lake with its characteristics and geography, and it isn't mentioned in local legends, and his fellow scholars have not found a trace of it in historical records.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8264.a;There must have been something strange afoot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8264.b;Perhaps the whole thing was a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8264.c;Will I find the island one day? Who knows what secrets it holds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8265.desc;I appear to have interrupted a heated debate. A courtiers have been discussing rumors they heard about a distant land known as the Isle of Colors, where men and women are like us, except for one thing: their skin is an unnatural color. What my courtiers cannot seem to agree on, however, is what that skin color is. Perhaps I can provide my input on the matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8265.a;The Isle of Colors does not exist. Someone made it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8265.b;Their skin's true color is pink - at least, that's what I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8265.c;I'd say surely dark blue is their skin's natural hue!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8265.d;I'd guess their skin is green, though this I have not seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8266.desc;When my official put the stamp of approval on the document, the ink got smudged. It still looks recognizable, but it does not look neat at all. On the other hand, rewriting the entire document would mean a waste of time that could be spent elsewhere, as it is a very big document.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8266.a;Rewrite it. We don't want any misunderstandings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8266.b;It is alright - leave it as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8267.desc;We spent all day looking for the lost document in the piles of papers and scrolls, but alas, it could not be found. It was an important document too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8267.a;What are we going to do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8268.desc;A local official of yours was accused of corruption. He confessed to being seduced by a young, unmarried noblewoman who asked him to overlook some illegal activities her brother partook in. He has subsequently fined and punished the wrongdoer brother, but he still allowed himself to get into this mess in the first place, not to mention he says he is still in love with the lady.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8268.a;All's well that ends well! Give my blessings for their marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8268.b;Fine the official and tell him not to do it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8268.c;Imprison the official. What he did was wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8268.d;Execute the official! Such weakness is unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8269.desc;You've heard about one of your lesser officials who is rumored to be incorruptible. Fascinated, you visit him incognito one day, pretending to be a typical nobleman. You offer him bribes of all sorts, promises of fame and glory, and beautiful women, but he seems unmoved. Finally, when you reveal yourself, he still remains unmoved, calmly saying he was merely doing his job.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8269.a;Why doesn't he treat me more special than others?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8269.b;Good to see I have dependable people working for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8269.c;How admirable! Reward him for his efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8269.d;I need someone like him by my side at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8270.desc;I've misplaced some critical documents and will have to meet with some officials soon about issues related to those documents. What am I going to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8270.a;I'm the [Root.GetTitle], they won't dare to reprimand me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8270.b;Admit my mistake and promise to make up for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8270.c;Make up some excuse - my horse ate the documents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8270.d;Pretend I'm sick so I won't have to meet them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8271.desc;You notice a stain on a scroll you're reading. The blotch is awfully distracting. What could have caused it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8271.a;Gross! I don't want to touch that scroll now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8271.b;It's probably just water or juice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8272.desc;I am receiving some envoys and notice that I am standing a few inches behind where I should ideally stand, if I wanted to follow proper court etiquette and protocol. I take a small step forward to prevent a faux pas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8272.a;That was a close one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8273.desc;I sneezed in the middle of a meeting with my counselors. No one said "bless you" to me, as if they did not notice!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8273.a;It's no matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8273.b;No one cares about me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8273.c;This makes me angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8274.desc;"It's our policy - we can't go against it," you overhear one of your bureaucrats explaining to another.\n\nThe other bureaucrat frowns. "If we do it that way, we'll waste a lot of time. The commoners are depending on us to help them.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8274.a;Continue walking along.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8274.b;Tell them following policy is important.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8274.c;Tell them to ignore the rules for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8275.desc;One of your minor officials has accused his superior of refusing to promote or reward him. Upon investigation, you find this minor official to be extremely talented and capable. However, when you discuss this with his superior, the senior official says this minor official came from an inferior, lesser background - his mother was once a whore! - so he needs to know his place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8275.a;Good point! Merit is nothing compared to lineage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8275.b;I disagree. The minor official will be promoted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8275.c;I'm sure they'll sort out their differences eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8275.d;If he's underappreciated, I'll have him work directly for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8276.desc;While holding court, I suddenly recall something extremely embarrassing and shameful I did years ago. No matter how hard I try, the memories gnaw at my consciousness and sense of decency, and I have to fight hard to ensure I don't turn into a sobbing wreck. I can't believe I did it back then - what was I thinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8276.a;My stupid mind! Curse you for remembering!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8276.b;Ignore it, ignore it, ignore it, ignore it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8276.c;Actually it was pretty funny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8277.desc;Lightning struck really close to me, but thankfully nothing happened!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8277.a;I was really lucky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8278.desc;I am visiting a village in my realm on some business. Before I leave, I stop by an herbalist's shop on a whim. I never realized there were so many different kinds of herbs, plants, minerals, and so on that one could use to make potions and poisons! The herbalist, an older woman with a stern face, looked annoyed at me for mindlessly loitering, but said nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8278.a;Can I purchase some for my physicians to use?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8278.b;I just wanted to browse for fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8278.c;This is probably useless quack medicine anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8279.desc;A wild wolf was spotted wandering near where you live. It does not appear to be an immediate danger to anyone, but no one knows what to do with it. Whenever you are nearby, it seems to stay back and stare at you with a serious expression, as if it were showing some sign of respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8279.a;Order my soldiers to chase it away. It's a danger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8279.b;If it wishes to stick around, I shall respect it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8280.desc;You were retiring for the night when you saw a most alarming sight on your bed: a single dagger, coated in blood. An investigation did not turn up any information as to who put it there and why. A few of your courtiers and guards suggest it may have been a prank.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8280.a;This is concerning! Increase security immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8280.b;Maybe it was a prank indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8280.c;Even if it wasn't a prank, I laugh in the face of danger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8280.d;That's not blood. It's colored water.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8281.desc;I am inspecting my troops today in their camps. I walk by some smiths, who are in the middle of repairing some weapons and armor. Everyone says they work hard to ensure my warriors are outfitted with the best gear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8281.a;Their hard work shall not be in vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8281.b;Those lazy bums should be working harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8282.desc;The blacksmiths of [Root.GetName] have gained renowned in recent years for the quality of their craft. This surely bodes well for their livelihoods, and for the local economy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8282.a;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8283.desc;I attended a ball at a local nobleman's house, and met a most interesting person. We talked about all sorts of things and had a great time. Unfortunately they had to leave early, and I didn't even get their name!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8283.a;Who was that?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8284.desc;I dreamt of traveling to a magnificent, mighty castle, so large and immense it towered over everything in nearby territory, even the forests and the mountains. It was an imposing sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8284.a;When I woke up, I wondered what it was all about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8285.desc;There are those who say Brazil, the Pindorama, is the most civilized of nations, that its laws are the most just, its officials the most righteous, its land the most prosperous, its people the most virtuous, its culture the most refined. Surely this must be true!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8285.a;We should be proud of our [Root.Culture.GetName] ways too.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8285.b;Indeed, we should learn from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8285.c;They are no better than anyone else!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8286.desc;A prominent nobleman was recently injured severely, and a physician was called to perform an emergency surgery on him. However, the nobleman died nevertheless. Some of the nobleman's relatives claimed the physician botched the procedure, but the physician and other learned men claim the surgery had a low chance of success to begin with. They come to you for judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8286.a;The physician did it on purpose, imprison him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8286.b;The physician made a mistake, but is innocent. He will pay a fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8286.c;The physician did his best. The family should drop the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8286.d;The physician did nothing wrong. The injury the nobleman had...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8287.desc;A notorious criminal recently escaped my prisons and afterwards went on a murder spree. He was subsequently captured and immediately executed by my guards on the spot, but this will undoubtedly be a stain on my authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8287.a;Terrible news!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8288.desc;They say a benevolent spirit resides in a small forest in [Root.GetName]. There are many stories circulating about how it has protected children that got lost in the woods at night, or how it helped hunters defeat dangerous predators.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8288.a;Let us hope it continues to protect the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8289.desc;On your way somewhere, you pass by a hill near a small village, and notice a young man and woman playing with their child. They look happy together, enjoying each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8289.a;That warms my heart. They seem like good people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8289.b;Seeing happy people makes me irrationally irritable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8290.desc;One of your maids reported that one of your courtiers left an inappropriate love letter on her bed. She appeals to you to do something about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8290.a;This is her problem, not mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8290.b;I will give him a stern talking to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8291.desc;A powerful nobleman living nearby has approached you with a complaint. Some locals are constructing some new buildings near his house. However, the noise they make is loud and annoying. It is technically on their property, so he can't do anything about it, but perhaps you can.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8291.a;Nobles should be respected! Halt construction immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8291.b;The locals aren't breaking any laws, so they can continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8291.c;I will discuss with the locals on how they can reduce the noise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8292.desc;They say a mad alchemist or wizard lives in [Root.GetName], dabbling in dangerous, arcane arts such as trying to find the potion to immortality, or pillaging graves for the bodies of dead maidens to sate his unnatural desires. It is said in his hut are thousands of profane scrolls and potions. However, no such madman can be found anywhere, according to the official authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8292.a;He must be somewhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8292.b;The peasants are just imagining things again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8293.desc;Your soldiers accidentally burst into the wrong person's house to make an arrest. It was an awkward situation all around.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8293.a;At least no one was hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8293.b;Pay that person a bit of money as an apology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8294.desc;I am hearing tales of the barbarian warlords who attacked the Rome generations ago. Attila of course is the most famous, but others are also well known such as Alaric, who sacked Rome yet died soon after, or Genseric, who transformed the Vandals into a Mediterranean power, or the ambitious Odoacer, who overthrew the last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8294.a;Attila was like the coming of the apocalypse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8294.b;Alaric's sacking of Rome is legendary in its brutality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8294.c;Genseric's daring and cunning is underrated in these annals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8294.d;Odoacer has earned his place in history for his deed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8295.desc;he gold and salt mines of Andes are many, and bring forth much wealth to the region. Yet there are rumors, legends and stories, about how beyond the mountain and jungles, there are even wealthier kingdoms and cities that make the Andean lords look impoverished by comparison. Could such places exist?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8295.a;Surely not. The Andean kingdoms are rich beyond measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8295.b;I think they do exist! The world out there is vast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8295.c;Who could possibly be richer than the [Root.Culture.GetName] people?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8296.desc;A noted scholar living nearby was known to have possessed an ancient scroll with indecipherable writing. He says he has a feeling that it is a hoax. However, there are those you know who claim it is actually a dark artifact capable of foul magic, and that it should be destroyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8296.a;Destroy that scroll! It could be dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8296.b;I wouldn't mind taking a look - it is harmless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8296.c;Why does this matter to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8296.d;Let's show this to other scholars, see what they think.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8297.desc;It was my first time at that tavern. I only came there to visit a member of the local elites, but the tavern's staff and regulars greeted me warmly and presented a gift of a simple but beautifully carved wooden bowl as a souvenir. It's not the usual thing a great [Root.GetTitle] would use, but it is mine to keep, if I so wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8297.a;Of course, I appreciate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8297.b;No thanks! This is worthless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8298.desc;There is a pewter spoon I am very fond of. Even though it is not the most dignified looking thing, maybe I should use it more regularly just in case.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8298.a;A good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8298.b;There are better spoons out there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8299.desc;I found a solid measuring rod, made of hardy stone. It could come in handy in the future, and help me with a variety of tasks and matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8299.a;Even for someone of my status, it is good to have around.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8299.b;I am not a lowly commoner playing with tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8300.desc;"A wonderful flower vase, for a wonderful [Root.GetTitle]," the merchant says, before presenting a luxurious looking flower vase. It is definitely of higher quality and better than the average flower vase! Should you buy it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8300.a;Yes, I should!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8300.b;No, I should not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8301.desc;I have acquired a leather knapsack for holding things. It's not the most beautiful thing ever made, but the craftsman who made it certainly designed it to have a rustic, simplistic charm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8301.a;Who knows how it could help me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8301.b;This is rubbish, give it a servant or dispose of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8302.desc;One of my guards recently got lost in the desert. Thankfully, it wasn't for long and he made it back to civilization safely. However, while he was in the desert, he came across a small ancient ruin, where he found a most interesting small statue. It was clearly made by the ancients, and he asks me if I want to keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8302.a;Certainly. It looks beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8302.b;No, it's all yours, since you found it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8303.desc;A peasant was digging near her house, doing the typical farm work peasants do, when she hit something hard. She investigated and found that it was a sculpted stone head of a mustached man. When she brought it to you, your wisest scholars said it did not resemble the art of any known peoples, and they suggested that perhaps it was the work of an ancient civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8303.a;I will keep it, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8303.b;I will keep it, but compensate the peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8303.c;The peasant lady can keep it for herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8303.d;Throw it away! It was clearly made by demon worshippers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8304.desc;Some merchants I am acquainted with wished to offer me a present. It turned out to be a weighing scale, made with fine materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8304.a;This will surely be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8304.b;I don't need that, but thank you nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8305.desc;You came across a hammer one day, and like how firm it feels in your hand. Though you are not a common craftsman, you can't help but admire this hammer. After all, aren't buildings, ships, and other great constructs made with such a simple thing? Perhaps even a great [Root.GetTitle] like you might have a use for it one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8305.a;I will keep it by my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8305.b;It is interesting, but nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8306.desc;I recently needed to repair part of my residence, so I hired some laborers to do the job. While I was inspecting their work, I noticed one man had a particularly fascinating shovel with him. Despite its simplicity and crudeness, it clearly displayed a sturdiness and power not typically seen in such a simple tool. The laborer, seeing my admiration for it, says I can keep it if I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8306.a;That sounds splendid. Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8306.b;No thanks, I just wanted a look.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8307.desc;I met a merchant specializing in beautiful works of art that would be excellent as home decorations. He showed me one particular painting he thought I might be interested in: a simple depiction of a lovely lake surrounded by fertile land, all under a beautiful, clear blue sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8307.a;I will buy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8307.b;I am not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8308.desc;You notice the merchant's shop has a painting of an ancient ruin, surrounded by beautiful wildlands. You asked if it was for sale, and the merchant said it could certainly be yours for a good price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8308.a;Good. I will purchase it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8308.b;I was merely curious, but am not interested in buying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8309.desc;The artist shows me one of their works: a gorgeous painting of a forest, full of lush vegetation that appears so real, it looks as if one could step into the painting and enter the world it depicts. Perhaps if I were to pay a decent price, the artist would sell it to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8309.a;Make an offer they can't refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8309.b;On the other hand, I don't want it anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8310.desc;A hunter in my realm went out hunting one day when he stumbled on a hole. Curious, he dug deeper, and found some ancient artifacts. Most were useless and broken, save for a flute made from what appears to be the bone of a giant creature or man. When the hunter presented it to me, he showed me how it could still play music - it sounded pleasant, if melancholy and strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8310.a;Thank you for your kind gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8310.b;No thanks - it looks dangerous and evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8311.desc;I can see the mountains from my home on a regular basis. It recently snowed a little up there, and I can see the peaks of the mountains capped with a clear layer of white.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8311.a;A majestic and inspiring sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8312.desc;I was traveling at night with a group of people. "We must move with haste, or else they'll catch us!" someone said.\n\nSuddenly, there was screams and fire. "Ambush! Run for it!" someone shouts. Too late - the next thing I knew, I was hit with  several arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8312.a;Then I woke up. What a nightmare!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8313.desc;Unsavory bandits blackmailed the orphaned, young nobleman into making a number of deals with them, which they of course reneged on. They decided they wanted to kill him and tried to storm his residence, but with luck and some quick thinking, the man managed to escape his enemies. Now he comes to you, begging for your protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8313.a;I can afford to send a few guards to take care of these criminals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8313.b;This is not my problem. Figure this out on your own!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8313.c;Stay at my court, where you will be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8314.desc;Unnerving news from [Root.GetName]. There was a village there that was relatively prosperous and sizeable. However, recently, all of its inhabitants simply vanished. People from nearby settlements organized search parties, and even some of your local officials went to investigate the matter, but no one from that village was ever found. Now, all that remains is the wind whistling through the village, dark, abandoned, and lifeless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8314.a;What on earth happened to that village?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8315.desc;Two commoners from powerful local families recently wed in [Root.GetName] - the groom a handsome, intelligent, virtuous youth, and the bride a beautiful, clever, gentle maiden. The two were apparently friends as children, and the match a perfect and blissful one. During the wedding, to the amazement of all, the clouds appeared in the shape of various good omens, and some claim that they heard sounds and voices from heaven above blessing this marriage!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8315.a;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8316.desc;I was playing outside with one of my friends from the village, running around and laughing, with not a care in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8316.a;Suddenly, [Root.GetSheHeOpp] looks up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8317.tooltip; \n\nWhat is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8317.desc;It begins raining out of nowhere, and within seconds the drizzle turns into a raging storm. "Hurry!" [Root.GetSheHeOpp] calls to me;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8317.a;We rush to find cover under a large boulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8318.tooltip;That was a close one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8318.desc;We huddle under the boulder, waiting for the rain to stop. The storm clears up about an hour later, but I realize my friend has fallen asleep, [Root.GetHerHisOpp] head resting on my shoulder!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8318.a;Let [Root.GetHerHisOpp] sleep... [Root.GetSheHeOpp] looks angelic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8318.b;Gently wake [Root.GetHerHisOpp] up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8318.c;Prank [Root.GetHerHisOpp] to make [Root.GetHerHisOpp] wake up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8319.desc;The rain fell harder earlier today, but now it has lessened to a light drizzle, so you and a few courtiers go outside to experience the fresh air. [target_VIET_rain_puddle_dancer.GetTitledName] suddenly starts hopping around in one of the puddles like a child, laughing and splashing around.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8319.a;Stop that now! How immature!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8319.b;That looks fun, but I'll stay out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8319.c;Let me join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8320.desc;It is raining heavily today. I sit by the window, gazing outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8320.a;This weather is so depressing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8320.b;I love rain - it is so healing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8321.desc;A large cistern was discovered in [Root.GetName]. It seems to have been used by ancient peoples to collect rainwater, and as it is still in relatively good condition, the locals plan to refurbish and reuse it. Perhaps we can lend some funds to help them in this endeavor? The economic and social benefits would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8321.a;Great idea! Lend them some financial support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8321.b;I will fully fund their efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8321.c;I have no interest in helping.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8322.desc;Today it is raining, yet the sun is still shining!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8322.a;Amazing sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8323.desc;Last night the rain was so heavy a part of my house collapsed and flooded. I will now have to dedicate some funds to fixing and restoring the mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8323.a;As if I didn't have enough problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8324.desc;In parts of [Root.GetName], colorful rain was reported to have fallen for several days. After some deliberation, locals consider this to be a good omen of things to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8324.a;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8325.desc;In parts of [Root.GetName], colorful rain was reported to have fallen for several days. After some deliberation, locals consider this to be a bad omen of things to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8325.a;Oh no....;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8326.desc;The book I read looked like a typical vapid romance at first. Instead, it was an epic love story with drama, comedy and tragedy, that raised poignant, difficult questions about human morality and mortality. Immensely moved, I now find it hard to fall asleep at night as I think about the characters I'd grown to love and their bittersweet fates. Will I ever read a story like that again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8326.a;I never expected to like that kind of story in the first place! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8327.desc;I was watching a play a traveling troupe was performing. Though it was a short and simple love story without much drama or conflict, the characters were likeable and realistic in their motivations and desires. Despite its simplicity and lack of tension, many in the audience loved the story.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8327.a;Those plebians - it's just some banal fluff!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8327.b;I admit, it brought a smile to my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8328.desc;A poet is reciting a tale about a historical event long ago before me and an audience. I realize he just made a mistake, and there are some inaccuracies in his retelling of what happened!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8328.a;Don't say anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8328.b;Correct him - history should not be lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8328.c;Correct him - the true history is more interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8328.d;Correct him - I want to show off my knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8329.desc;The book you are reading is dense and full of complex ideas about philosophy and the meaning of life. Even though the characters, plot, and setting are interesting, the book itself is an extremely difficult read and you feel like you cannot finish it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8329.a;Bear through it - I must discover its meaning!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8329.b;I give up! I have better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8330.desc;I was idly reading a book about historical events in ancient times. Suddenly, when I came across a particular section, disjointed images and scenes flashed before my mind, as if I was really there. My servants found me on the ground moments later, having fainted. They were skeptical when I described what happened, but the feelings of sadness, joy, hatred, love - I felt all that!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8330.a;Was I really there, in the past? Why am I here now?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8331.desc;You recently took the time to read through various books explaining the exploits and deeds of ancient heroes and warriors. It was informative, and helped you to better understand:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8331.a;Which tactics and strategies work, and which ones don't.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8331.b;What makes a person brave and able to fight the odds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8331.c;How to uphold justice and righteousness among all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8332.desc;You recently read a touching story about a pure-hearted romance between a young man and woman who had grown up as neighbors and friends. Their virtue and honesty helped them ensure many hardships so they could be united in marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8332.a;I hate stupid love stories. Why did I read that?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8332.b;It was an adorable tale about true love.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8333.desc;I see two of my servants on the other side of the room. They are trying to make small talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8333.a;Listen in on the conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8334.desc;"Heard any news from the other provinces?"\n"Nothing I'd like to talk about."\n"Bye."\n"Bye.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8334.a;That was really awkward.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8334.b;That was actually a coded conversation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8334.b.text;They were secretly exchanging gossip about...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8335.desc;You pass by a wayside shrine on the road. You remember one of the locals telling you that praying at these wayside shrines could bring one various kinds of blessings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8335.a;Let me pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8335.b;I need to hurry, I have business to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8336.desc;A wayshrine in [Root.GetName] has recently gained fame for the blessings it supposedly granted to those who pray at it. Pilgrims and travelers are making their way there in droves, seeking the boons it provides.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8336.a;Perhaps I should visit there one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8337.desc;You are visiting a shop in a town selling various general merchandise on discount, ranging from tableware to rugs and various herbal remedies. It's as if everything's on sale. The shopkeeper tells you, "You don't want the very best. You want cheap. I got cheap.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8337.a;I like the sound of that! Let me buy some.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8337.b;You mistake me for a common peasant, good sir!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8337.c;Just browsing - don't mind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8338.desc;I am at an inn for business. While waiting for the other party to arrive, the innkeeper tells me a story about a local alchemist who lived in the area centuries ago and was famed for his abilities. She says he was also a connoisseur of wines, and developed a special kind of wine that could supposedly improve one's eyesight at night, and it was popular among local guards who had night duty. Local lore knows it as the "Shadow Banish." She then offers me a bottle of this famed wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8338.a;Sure, this can't hurt, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8338.b;No thanks! That looks dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8338.c;Can I take it back with me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8338.a.tooltip; \n\nYou ended up feeling rather off later that evening, and that night you had a strange dream about waking up with your hands bound in a horse-drawn cart full of prisoners going down a cold, snowy mountain road.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8338.c.tooltip; \n\nThough the innkeeper won't sell me the recipe for that wine, I will use my knowledge to see if I can reverse engineer this recipe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8339.desc;While traveling, my entourage and I come across a circle of burnt, dead trees. It is an unusual sight and curiosity gets the better of us. As we enter this dark grove we see a large rock surrounded by several spikes with skulls skewered on them. On top is a chest filled with many treasures - gold, jewelry, gems, and more. No one has heard of this location, eerily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8339.a;Let's leave - this place seems cursed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8339.b;Take the loot with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8340.desc;I meet a local woman who is a renowned dog trainer. Under her expert guidance, she has trained many dogs to be hunters, companions, guards, and more. When I ask her what her secret is, she scoffs and says: "You got your people, and you got your dogs. Dogs are loyal and stupid. People are smart and devious. I'll stick with dogs.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8340.a;I cannot disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8340.b;An interesting perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8340.c;But people can be good too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8341.desc;"I'm here to relieve you," I hear one of my nearby guards say as he takes up his post.\n\n"Another day, another coin," the other one says as he takes his leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8341.a;Their hard work is appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8341.b;They are just doing their duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8341.c;Wait a moment... isn't today your day off?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8342.desc;On a visit to a village of my realm, I am talking with a guardsman stationed there. He looks around, eyes fearful, as he tells me: "If you have to travel in these parts, by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] stay on the roads. The wilderness just isn't safe anymore. We've had sightings, you see... the demons.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8342.a;If demons are about, they're no match for brave men like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8342.b;Hah! Just paranoia. That's ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8342.c;Thanks for letting me know. I'll be careful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8342.d;Have you heard any news from the other provinces?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8343.desc;A burly woman appears before my court, claiming to be a knight of some knightly order I have never heard of. A few courtiers wonder if she is just a harlot trying to cheat me, but her scarred and rugged face, and brawny build suggests otherwise. Maybe she is an adventurer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8343.a;Tell her to go to fight some bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8343.b;Haha! A woman thinks she can fight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8343.c;Send her off and ignore her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8344.tooltip; \n\nShe will chicken out or get herself killed, so either way I think that solves the problem cleverly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8344.desc;To my surprise, the woman claiming to be a knight returned to my court after having killed all the bandits. I sent a couple soldiers to investigate and they confirmed her claim. Amazing! These bandits had been terrorizing a village in my realm for a couple years now, and none of my soldiers could beat them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8344.a;Thank her, but do not reward her. She is untrustworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8344.b;Reward the woman but tell her to be on her way afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8344.c;Reward the woman and praise her valor before the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8345.desc;The mysterious woman thanks me for giving her a chance. She admits she is a self-proclaimed knight, but for good reason. Long ago, her close friend was robbed and murdered by bandits. She swore an oath of vengeance, which she seeks to fulfill by fighting bandits and finding a righteous lord to serve. She traveled far and wide, wandering across the world upholding justice and punishing evildoers, but never found a lord worthy of her services until now. If you will accept her, despite her unorthodox origins, then she promises to serve you loyally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8345.a;Politely decline her offer and tell her to take her reward and be on her way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8345.b;Invite her to join my court and serve me, as she wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8346.desc;A renowned scholar is visiting me today. He is quite a character. When I ask to talk about himself, he tells me: "I'm a retired scholar. Sleep late, read trashy books. I don't keep up with other scholars' affairs anymore. I spent 40 years studying many different topics and teaching at some schools. Good years, but I don't miss it. Now I'm completely useless, and proud of it.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8346.a;Such a waste of intellect!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8346.b;It isn't my place to comment on his lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8346.c;Why don't you find purpose by working for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8347.desc;I met a most interesting woman at the local tavern, who is quite notorious in her village for her openly blasphemous views. She told me: "They call me the God-Hater. Yes. I hate [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. And any gods worshipped by anyone. They can all bite my garters. And if you don't like it, YOU can bite my garters, too.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8347.a;This heretic must be punished by the religious authorities!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8347.b;I do not care about what this bizarre madwoman thinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8347.c;I can't anger the religious authorities, but I can respect a kindred spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8348.desc;There is a widowed noblewoman in a nearby village nicknamed "Runs in Circles" due to her erratic and strange behavior. Though kind and friendly, she went mad years ago. Today, while I passed by this village, she asked me if I had crunchy apples and carrots for her. I told her I did not, and she flew into a panic and ran around in circles continuously screaming "Ni ni ni ni ni!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8348.a;I do not have time to deal with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8348.b;The poor woman! I hope she will be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8348.c;Ha! I like her. Can we invite her to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8349.desc;We came across a ruined stone structure that resembles an ancient fort. Feeling adventurous, we explored it a bit given it wasn't that huge, and we found a chest filled with some gold trinkets and jewelry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8349.a;Finders keepers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8349.b;We should not take what belongs to the dead of this place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8350.desc;In my dreams, I came to a village situated atop a tall hill, overlooking a gorgeous lake. There was a big problem: a wizard accidentally turned all the villagers invisible. I helped the wizard fix the problem and the villagers became visible again. As I woke up, I wondered what the deeper meaning of that dream was, if there was one. Surely, the dream was telling me that I need to...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8350.a;Be truthful to myself and others, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8350.b;Find out that which is hidden and threatens me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8350.c;Go out to relax - how beautiful the outside can be!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8350.d;Nothing. The dream was meaningless. Probably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8351.desc;In [Root.GetName], there have been several sightings of a supposed giant crab. It is said to hide along beaches and the mudline of rivers, before appearing and terrifying passerby. More skeptical minds believe there is no basis for these claims, as no one has gotten hurt yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8351.a;Fascinating nevertheless, though!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8351.b;Is it a sign for someone born under the sign of Cancer like me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8352.desc;I peacefully fell asleep, and found myself in the land of dreams. I was an adventurer who had arrived at a large, bustling port city, a picturesque town full of marbled, stone buildings. It was a picturesque town. Anyways, there were many sights to see, both within the city and outside near it, and in the end I decided to...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8352.a;Explore the golden coastline nearby and see what secrets it holds;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8352.b;Make my way to a nearby shrine, nicknamed the Lady's Stone by locals ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8352.c;Visit the docks, and find the houses of pleasure near it;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8352.d;Walk through the streets and take in the sights;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8353.desc;Some have told me that the process of dying is like stepping into a strange but gentle dream. Is there any truth to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8353.a;Perhaps. But thinking about this is unhelpful while we're alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8353.b;Life is but a dream as well, is it not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8353.c;I won't know for sure until I begin my final journey myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8353.d;The scholars of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith say that when one dies...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8354.desc;Ever since I was a child, there was one servant in our family I was always close to and was like a second parent to me. She passed away of old age a couple days ago, and I have been greatly affected by this, feeling drained and mentally exhausted at times, trying to process this event. Strangely, last night, she visited me in a dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8354.a;I try to recall what happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8355.desc;We met somewhere in my dream - I cannot tell where, but all I recall was some sort of brilliant light, and the feeling of a gentle breeze caressing my face. My servant told me she had always loved me like her own child, but now she had to go. She embraced me, wished me the best in life, and said goodbye for one last time before her final journey. I felt much better after that dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8355.a;Farewell... but will it be forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8356.desc;One of my trusted servants is on his deathbed. His death will come as a blow to many of us, as we respected the old man for his patience, humility, and wisdom, which he tried his best to impart to us. I and others are by his bedside as his final hour draws near, and I ask him if he is afraid of the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8356.a;He smiles gently.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8357.desc;"End? No, the journey doesn't end here," he says. "Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass. And then you see it.... White shores... and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise." He looks at me serenely, before closing his eyes. Several hours later, he passes away. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8357.a;I stay by his bedside for some time, contemplating his words.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8358.desc;I walk through a vast expanse of green grass, covered above by a sky of pure, pale blue. I come to a river where I see many people. I recognize them all as people in my life who passed away, some many years ago, from relatives and friends to old servants.\n\nOne goes up to me and says in a calm but concerned tone, "Why are you here? You will join us on this journey one day, but it is not your time yet. But you can enjoy the sunshine and fresh air with us for a little longer.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8358.a;I wake up peacefully, after spending time relaxing in that strange dream world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8359.desc;While walking near my residence, I spotted something on the ground by a patch of grass. To my surprise, I found a rat lying on its side. I was not fearful of it, as I realized it was dying. Its eyes gazed at me with a look full of solemn clarity, in a way one did not expect from such a creature - almost as if it was telling me something. Then, it stopped moving, and passed away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8359.a;There was something profound about it. Life is full of wonders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8359.b;That was weird. But a rat's a rat. Well now! Back to my walk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8359.c;An extraordinary rat! I'll cover its body with leaves as a sign of respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8360.desc;That night, I dreamt I was standing in front of an old woman I never met before. Despite her age, she carried herself with grace, and she curtsied me. "Thank you for your kind gesture earlier today," she said. "Most would have ignored me. Whatever your intentions, your noble deed brings me peace in the afterlife, and I can move on." When I woke up, I was confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8360.a;There was no way... could it have been?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8361.desc;An acquaintance of mine was on his deathbed, unconscious and unresponsive for days. His family had gathered around him to pray and prepare his soul for the afterlife, when all of a sudden, he sat up, alert and sharp. His family was relieved and tried to talk to him, thinking he had recovered somehow, yet he just kept asking for me to come visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8361.a;I hastened to come to his bedside to witness this little miracle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8362.tooltip; \n\nI wonder why he wanted to see me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8362.desc;When I arrived at his house and entered his bedroom, he clapped with joy, and beckoned me to sit next to him. He inquired about various matters of state and provided me advice, claiming it was given to him by the wise spirits of the deceased. We humored him for an hour or so until he said he was tired, and bid all farewell. The moment he closed his eyes, he passed away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8362.a;Strangely, his advice turned out to be actually very helpful. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8363.desc;I am pouring over a document at my desk at night when I see an adorable little girl scurrying back and forth in my room. Upon seeing each other, we both stare in confusion, so I ask her who she is and why she's here. "I'm cold and hungry," she mumbles shyly. Feeling sorry for her, I point to some food I had left on my table, and tell her to eat some.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8363.a;"Thank you, my [Root.GetLordLady]," she squeaks, before she eats.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8364.desc;I suddenly wake up, realizing I must have dozed off while reading, and that the little girl must have been from a dream I had. I go to finish the rest of my food, but contrary to what I remember, none of my meal is left, save for a few crumbs.\n\nThe next morning, when I ask about her, I learned her appearance matched one of my guard's daughters, who passed away from illness a few days ago. The guard, a devout [Root.Religion.GetName] believer, tells me he is certain I helped her soul pass into the afterlife, and thanks me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8364.a;She was a polite, kind child. She is surely at peace now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8364.b;It must be a coincidence, but if it makes you feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8365.desc;A trusted guard recently got injured, and while it thankfully isn't too painful, it's clear that it doesn't bode well for his health as he is now bedridden for much of the day. He is old and about to retire, anyways. One morning, you pay a visit when he tells you his grandparents stopped by just before you did. You point out that they died decades ago, but he assures you they did visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8365.a;Are you really sure? Maybe you are imagining things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8365.b;Really! A truly marvelous thing. I hope they mean well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8365.c;Perhaps they did come. The universe is full of mysteries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8366.desc;You receive word that your trusted guard who recently got injured and was on his deathbed just passed away. Strangely, the day before that, his relatives said he told them that his grandparents came to help him pack for a journey. Could that have been a sign of things to come? Strange things have always preceded death, after all, as the stories tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8366.a;He will be missed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8367.desc;On an official trip, you are passing by one of the villages of your realm. As you leave the borders of the village, you see something odd by a bush and, together with your entourage, go to investigate. To your shock, it is the corpse of a haggard-looking old man in rags. You demand an explanation from the villagers, who say he was the local town beggar who just passed away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8367.a;I see. Very well, it is none of my concern - carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8367.b;Please dispose of the corpse, will you? It's unclean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8367.c;Beggar or not, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_beggars_deserve_dignified_burials_too; \n\nYou make the villagers give the man a proper funeral. Yet instead of being angry, the villagers are moved by your compassion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8368.desc;There are those who argue a quick death is better, for it will be less painful and you won't have as much to worry and ruminate over. Others believe a slow and gradual death is preferable, for it gives one time to let go of regrets, pray, and make peace with one's family, friends, and [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8368.a;I prefer a quick death - things are simpler that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8368.b;It's better if one has time to prepare before passing on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8369.desc;Several hooligans were recently caught trying to raid a cemetery not too far from where I live, and they were apprehended by the local watchmen. This, of course, is absolutely forbidden out of respect for the spirits of the dead, and it is now up to me to determine the fate of these men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8369.a;Release the desperate, poor men. They've learned their lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8369.b;To think they wanted to desecrate the dead! Toss them in prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8370.desc;Stories abound of ghosts frequently passing through a village in [Root.GetName]. The locals are of two minds, unsure on how to react to this. Some are terrified, and believe it is best to send in holy men and women to exorcise these restless spirits. Others view this through a more rational lens, seeing it as a blessing and an opportunity to honor and say prayers to the dead. Yet others say these are all just some hallucinations by deranged individuals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8370.a;Strange stories, indeed! Who knows what the truth is?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8371.desc;In one of the larger villages of [Root.GetName], a respected elder recently passed away. He was beloved by all for his virtue and wisdom. Few had anything bad to say about him. His funeral attracted many who wished to pay their respects to him, and some even claim that his spirit will provide the land with many blessings before he passes into the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8371.a;May his soul rest in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8372.desc;Last night, I was in bed when I heard a noise. Alarmed, I sat up, and saw a young man pacing to and fro, as if busy with some matter. He apologized to me for the disturbance, and sheepishly said, "I apologize, my [Root.GetLordLady]. I need to take care of business in the underworld and accidentally stumbled here." We exchanged small talk before he left. The next morning, when I asked the people of my household about it, no one reported ever seeing such a man. It is most bizarre! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8372.a;Maybe it was just a dream, yet it did not feel like a dream....;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8373.desc;I am walking down the road when a pretty young woman in white robes approaches me. On her shoulder is a pet owl, though for some reason I suddenly recall that the sacred animal of the [Root.Religion.GetName] deity of death was an owl. The girl smiles, revealing an oddly long tongue, and she asks if she can kiss me. As her owl flutters away, I feel something is off.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8373.a;I hastily make an excuse and leave the stranger alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8373.b;Oh, I'm just nervous! Come to me, my beauty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8374.desc;The girl moves forward, but her tongue suddenly extends forth, becoming unnaturally long. Her pretty visage turns into that of an old, withered hag. I am trapped, unable to move. She licks my face, and I feel darkness overtake me.... And then I wake up. It was just a nightmare, but how was I that stupid to be seduced by the Goddess of Death! An ill omen, but at least it was just a dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8374.a;Right...?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8375.desc;Shortly before a respected member of the local [Root.Culture.GetName] community died recently, several relatives claimed to witness the shrieking and wailing of banshees, both of gruesome or comely visage. Today, though, I wondered to myself: while people understandably fear these female spirits, isn't it nice to have a warning when something bad might happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8375.a;At least that's what I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8375.b;It's stupid superstition either way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8376.desc.a;[target_VIET_myling_courtier.GetTitledName] claimed that last night, [target_VIET_myling_courtier.GetSheHe] came across a Myling - the ghost of a dead child who had been wrongly killed by its parents. [target_VIET_myling_courtier.GetFirstName] knew it was a dangerous but inescapable situation, and rushed to guide the child to a nearby cemetery, a hallowed ground. Yet, contrary to the scary [Root.Religion.GetName] tales, the child was friendly and thanked [target_VIET_myling_courtier.GetFirstName] for [target_VIET_myling_courtier.GetHerHis] compassion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8376.a;Ha! An interesting tale. You always loved making up stories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8376.b;It's either a dream or a lie. Mylings are vengeful beings, not harmless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8376.c;Oh dear! At least the ghost seemed like a kind one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8377.desc;On the road, my entourage and I come across a [Root.Religion.GetName] holy man, dressed in robes. He is kneeling on the ground, looking at nowhere in particular, as he chants some prayers.\n\nAfter he finishes, I ask him what he was doing, and he explains that recently, a woman died here in an accident. She was a poor woman with no family, so this holy man, out of compassion, gave her a modest but dignified funeral. He hopes her spirit will find peace with [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8377.a;For a mere peasant? What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8377.b;I understand. Carry on, then. We shan't bother you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8377.c;How noble! May we join you in praying for her spirit?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8378.desc;A most amusing yet strange tale! I know of this noblewoman in my realm who is quite annoying. She's not a bad person, but she's unbelievably chatty and intensely emotional, and if crossed can be quite a nag. Though middle aged, she died a few weeks ago... only to come back to life a few hours later. She said that apparently Death came to get her, but was so fed up with her company that he hurried to take her back home so he could come get her later. She's still healthy today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8378.a;Ha ha! I do feel sorry for old Death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8378.b;She was seeing things at the time, but that's funny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8379.desc;I rest in bed one evening when I hear a knock on the door. Thinking it is one of my servants, I beckon them in, only to see a pleasant young woman I do not recognize. Suddenly, there is a chill in the air, and the candles flicker out. The stranger looks at me with her dark eyes, and I hold my breath in anticipation. "I am Death," she says in a low, yet soothing whisper. "It's time for...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8379.a;Wait... what's going on?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8380.tooltip; \n\nIs it... is it time for me to go?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8380.title;Common Mistake;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8380.desc;Surprisingly, I am calm as I wait for her to finish - if it is my time to go, there isn't much I can do. But she stops herself and looks around, as if she just realized where she is. Suddenly, the candles are alight once more, and she bows to me.\n\nI look at her in bewilderment as she says, "I'm so sorry! You're the wrong person... I knew I got lost somehow. Dammit... why does this happen to me? I'm so unprofessional. Oh! My sincere apologies, I know this is such an inconvenience to you. And... um, by the way, I know I'm not in any position to ask, but do you by any chance know the way to...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8380.a;Um.... Is it the village by the river of.... And it's north of.... I know it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8381.tooltip; \n\nTo be fair to her, it is confusing if you've never been there before, so I kindly provide her some directions. I reassure her, when she looks embarrassed, "It's a common mistake everyone makes. The roads in that part can be disorienting!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8381.title;Good Directions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8381.desc;"Thank you so much!" the maiden says cheerfully, with a beaming smile before she leaves. "I'll be back later, but not today. I wish you nothing but luck and fortune, [Root.GetFirstName]!"\n\nThe next morning, no one knows what I'm talking about when I ask if they saw a girl with the same description as that maiden. I chalk up the whole incident as a dream my sleep-deprived mind concocted, until I later receive news in the afternoon that an acquaintance of mine died last night.\n\nHe happened to live in that village the maiden needed to travel to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8381.a;That absentminded girl who visited me was... Death?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8381.b;I'm pretty sure it's a coincidence and was just a dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8382.desc;A wandering holy man is stopping by our court today, and telling us stories of the various phenomena he has encountered, as he is sometimes called on by people to resolve supernatural problems. For instance, recently, as he passed by a village in my domain, he had to exorcise a mischievous ghost who made loud noises and threw around objects in a peasant's house.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8382.a;Fascinating! Some spirits are just as troublesome as the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8382.b;I am not sure whether I find such a story believable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8383.desc;Commoners have always told tales about corpses rising from the dead if their funerals were not performed properly, or if they died in unjust ways. Lately I hear more and more rumors about such occurrences in the region, but the scholars and clergy assure me such things are mere superstitions. No true believer of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith would ever believe in such drivel!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8383.a;I agree very much with the views of the learned men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8383.b;You can never be so sure, right? Maybe the peasants are right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8384.desc;I was thinking today - all the people who have come and go since the beginning of time.... It is interesting, if somber, to imagine what they would think of us, their descendants, and whether they would be proud or disappointed in us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8384.a;It is a good question.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8385.desc;When I die one day - as all do, inevitably - will people still remember me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8385.a;Of course! I'm such a great [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8385.b;Why wouldn't they? They'll still remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8385.c;They won't, and I hate that that is what will happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8385.d;No, but that's not a bad thing. Life will go on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8386.desc;I'm paying a visit to an acquaintance of mine, who nearly died in an accident when she was a young woman, and was in fact unconscious for a week after it before she slowly recovered. She said that during that week, she actually had a glimpse of the afterlife, and she said it looked like a simple yet beautiful garden filled with light. The experience moved her greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8386.a;Perhaps that is what the afterlife will be. We'll see for sure, one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8387.desc;I'm paying a visit to an acquaintance of mine, who nearly died in an accident when he was a young man, and was in fact unconscious for a week after it before he slowly recovered. He said that during that week, he actually had a glimpse of the afterlife, and he said it looked like a quiet, peaceful beach full of bright sunshine. The experience moved him greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8387.a;Perhaps that is what the afterlife will be. We'll see for sure, one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8388.desc;Though my parents have passed away for quite some time, I suddenly recalled a warm, happy memory of them today. Regardless of my feelings about them while they were alive, even after death, my memories of them can bring me joy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8388.a;I am glad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8389.desc;In several villages of [Root.GetName], there are reports of strange processions of people at night, wearing somber clothing, and accompanied by bustling winds and a chill in the air. Locals believe that for whatever reason, these are spirits of the dead going to and fro. Others, such as more rational scholars and clergy, think this might simply just be a few scattered accounts of hallucinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8389.a;Strange times we live in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8390.desc;Several heinous murders were recently committed in [Root.GetName], the victims' corpses horrifically mutilated. Authorities were unable to find the perpetrator until local guards devised a cunning ambush and caught him, who turned out to be a young nobleman whom everyone thought was friendly and kind! He cackled with glee as he lunged at the guards and they were forced to kill him, for he preferred to die rather than be caught alive and be brought to trial for his crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8390.a;A tragic story. Alas! Such madmen exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8390.b;Reward the guards for their deeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8391.desc;Phantoms were observed in large numbers in a specific region of [Root.GetName], though the witnesses claimed these ghosts were harmless, and were preoccupied with engaging in mundane activities like chatting, enjoying feasts, singing, dancing, and playing various games - almost like as if there was a separate town of ghosts at night. No reputable scholar or clergy has been able to verify these claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8391.a;We must give these spirits their due respect!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8391.b;These silly peasants are hallucinating things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8392.desc;The death of several important officials in [Root.GetName] around the same time has thrown the region into a bit of chaos, given the difficulties in securing reliable replacements for several positions at the same time. This will likely cause some disruptions to the local administration, but hopefully it will be brief.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8392.a;Unfortunate, but let's do our best.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8392.b;Thankfully, I already prepared some contingency plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8393.desc;A powerful local official in [Root.GetName] recently died. Given his prominence, many mourned at first, until evidence of severe corruption was discovered among his belongings and properties, from bribery to involvement in smuggling to abuses of local peasants. He cunningly covered it all up under his benevolent facade. After all this came out and we learned of the mind-boggling magnitude of his corruption, it's certain province will do much better without him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8393.a;A pity we didn't catch him while he was still alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8394.desc;A hermit has lived in the wilderness of [Root.GetName] for decades, engaging in meditation, prayer, and other spiritual practices. He was kind and always offered spiritual teachings for any who requested it, though he refused all offerings of food, drink, or other luxuries. Now, news arrives that he has passed away while meditating - and yet, his corpse still sits upright, and does not decay at all. Locals have begun to make pilgrimage to receive blessings from the hermit's presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8394.a;A most interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8395.desc;A runestone has recently been discovered in [Root.GetName]. It appears to be centuries old at the least, and though the writing is difficult to read, you were able to find a local scholar who could translate it, and who says the runestone seems to have been carved and raised many generations ago following the death of some important local figure in their honor. Little else can be discerned, given the writing is so worn out and in an ancient style.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8395.a;A piece of history, no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8396.desc;An old woman passed away in [Root.GetName] recently. Though a humble villager, this beloved "grandmother of all" lived a very long time - more than a century, some claim - and was of humble and virtuous temperament, doing her best to guide the community and provide her wisdom to all. She received visitors from even local nobles from other villages nearby. There have already been claims that her spirit will bless these lands for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8396.a;This grandmother will be sorely missed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8397.desc;There are many places who ascribe all manner of ill omens to black cats, that seeing one is a portent of death. Today, I just happened to come across a stray black cat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8397.a;I will go away as quickly as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8397.b;I fear no cat. It even looks sweet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_silly_rationality_about_black_cat; \n\nThough you feel a strange feeling, as if... something isn't right.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8398.desc;The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have always seen black cats as a sign of good luck and fortune, so long as they are treated with respect. Yet I hear tales of people from other lands fearing them as harbingers of death and destruction, and even sad and gut-wrenching tales of black cats being tortured and murdered because of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8398.a;Such are the strange and horrifying customs of others!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8399.desc;I am traveling in a less populated and more rugged part of my realm, and my entourage and I come across a number of corpses, and the stench of decaying flesh is noticeable to everyone. Judging by the armor and clothing on the bodies, as well as the wounds on them, it seems that this may have been the scene of a recent battle between rival bandit gangs that infest this region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8399.a;These lowly people deserve to be food for vultures and crows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8399.b;Let's properly dispose of these bodies, lest they rise as vengeful spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8399.c;Bandits or not, we should give them a funeral, to ease their souls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8400.desc;I was making my way through a local town market when I felt something was watching me. I looked around and saw nothing, yet could not shake off the feeling. My concerned guards thought maybe I sensed an assassin. A passing holy man noticed my anxiety, and told me cryptically: "Ah, a ghost seems attached to you. Don't worry - it's a gentle spirit who means no harm, and who is more curious and playful than anything. It might even help you out, and will leave you alone once its curiosity has been sated.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8400.a;He had disappeared into the crowds before I could question him further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8401.desc;A local townsman is accused of abominable crimes! Known for his insatiable lust, he frequents houses of ill repute and tries to seduce any woman, from innocent virgins to old widows. He even went to graveyards at night to fornicate with the lonely female ghosts - or so his accusers claim to have witnessed. Others argue that despite his vices, there is no sound evidence of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8401.a;Clearly baseless stories made up by his enemies. Ignore the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8401.b;This man is a necrophiliac! He must be executed immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8401.c;Such terrible things - he will be imprisoned, make no mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8402.desc;My servant's pet dog died. As he was really close to the dog, he's been feeling rather dejected and sad, which has been affecting his ability to perform his duties. Perhaps I should say something to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8402.a;Silly boy, it's just a stupid dog. Get over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8402.b;Shape up or else I'll punish you severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8402.c;Cheer up! We'll find you a new dog.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8402.d;It's in a better place now but take your time to grieve. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8403.desc;While I am in one of the more distant parts of my realm, I come across an ancient tombstone partly buried in the ground. On it are etched the words:\n\nRemember me as you pass by,\nAs you are now, so once was I,\nAs I am now, so you will be,\nPrepare for death and follow me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8403.a;Alas! We are but dust and shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8404.desc;Last night, I had a most wonderful dream! I found myself basking in a realm of infinite light - nothing but light - and saw before me many men and women, some of whom I recognized as my deceased relatives. Even those I did not recognize I knew were my distant ancestors. We neither talked nor interacted directly, and I merely basked in their benevolent presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8404.a;After I woke up, I felt most blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8405.desc;The herbs I bought today should help me stay healthy. Per the physician's instructions, I am to drink it daily as a tonic to maintain my health until I run out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8405.a;I hope this is a good investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8406.desc;A quack doctor who had been notoriously operating in the area for some time has finally been arrested for selling fraudulent medical concoctions, some known to be deadly. Unlike other physicians who have proper medicinal training on topics like the four humors and herbology, this one is a conman who wants to dupe idiots and take their money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8406.a;Send him to prison immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8406.b;Force him to drink one of his poisons!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8406.c;Let him go. I'm sure he learned his lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8407.desc;I am listening to a debate between two local physicians on the best way to treat a certain medical ailment. Though I don't understand everything they discuss, their expoundings on various medical theories and ideas, such as the four humors, how the various organs of the body work, and what herbs are most effective, are strangely fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8407.a;How learned they must be!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8407.b;"You're both incorrect. Galen said that if a person is coughing, and blood and bile...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8408.desc;A learned man is traveling through town to exchange knowledge with the physicians in the area. He is knowledgeable about medical treatments, particularly surgery, and has invited several of us to go see a demonstration of his surgical skills when he operates on a lesser nobleman. It will be a rather squeamish affair, though. Should I attend?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8408.a;I've dealt with worse - this sounds educational!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8408.b;No. A [Root.GetTitle] like me has more pressing concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8408.c;Perhaps I can even assist his procedure with my skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8409.desc;I overhear one of my servants muttering, "Oh dear, was it two spoons or three?"\n\nWhen I asked her what she was talking about, she tells me she forgot how much medicine she needed to take for her recent stomach pains.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8409.a;Uh... no idea myself. Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8409.b;You're clearly a moron if you forgot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8409.c;Actually, it should be four spoons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8410.desc;One of your courtiers accidentally took the wrong medicine. It appeared they confused two different concoctions they were supposed to take at different times and with different doses. One can only hope there are no significant negative side effects to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8410.a;Oh dear! That sounds unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8411.desc;You are drinking some herbal tea that is meant to be a good health tonic. However, you drink a little too fast and burn your tongue in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8411.a;Ouch! But at least it's good for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8412.desc;I overhear a scholar and a merchant debate the merits of quarantines during plagues. The scholar says that wise men and physicians have always advised that those with contagious diseases must be kept away from the healthy. The merchant says isolating communities will destroy business opportunities and render the settlements impotent and weak. What do I think?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8412.a;It is a silly idea - how can we live if we all cower in fear, alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8412.b;We need to listen to the scholars' wisdom to survive hardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8412.c;I honestly don't care about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8413.desc;I had a sore throat earlier and took this herbal concoction to make it better, as some suggested to me. Though I'll admit my throat does feel better, the medicine tasted disgusting!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8413.a;Ugh! I can't make that taste go away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8414.desc;I stopped by the kitchen to see what my cooks were up to. They are preparing some dishes made with panch poron, a spice mix made from five seeds. Unlike other spice mixes, here, the seeds are not ground into powder.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8414.a;Carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8414.b;Don't use that! I prefer powdered spices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8415.desc;My servants give me some traditional stringed cheese, which often has black caraway added to it for taste. It is a good snack.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8415.a;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8416.desc;One of my servants was having shortness of breath earlier today for some unknown reason, and it looked serious until another servant, known for being sharp, immediately grabbed some black caraway and made the other servant eat them. The seed is known for helping with cases of shortness of breath, and helped stabilize the ill servant. While the ill servant has gone to the physician to see if anything is wrong, perhaps I should reward my other quick-witted servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8416.a;These are just mere servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8416.b;Some nice words and a gift will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8416.c;Promote the servant to a full courtier.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8417.desc;I was gifted some shampoo made from the juice of a plant called the kaffir lime. It is quite popular and said to be effective against lice, dandruff, and other things that might bother the hair and scalp.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8417.a;A nice gift, and much appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8417.b;Perhaps my spouse might like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8417.c;I have a courtier who might want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8418.desc;It is often tradition to season simple dishes, such as cabbage and cucumber, with the dried leaves and seed of the lovage plant to add some flavor. There are some who claim it can turn even these simple vegetables into something delicious! I tried a sample of lovage mixed in vegetables today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8418.a;It was actually quite good!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8418.b;Bleh! It's just food of the peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8419.desc;You are visiting an acquaintance's house and notices she maintains a lot of plants, specifically the mahleb cherry, on her property. It is commonly used for many different breads and desserts in [Root.Culture.GetName] cooking. She says you are welcome to take some back home for your cooks to use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8419.a;Don't mind if I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8419.b;No thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8420.desc;You are drinking some herbal tea made from the majoram plant. They say it is a symbol of happiness and joy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8420.a;The tea tastes good, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8421.desc;I somehow got myself a lot of mastic. Using it as a chewing gum is said to have many medicinal benefits, on top of reducing any unpleasant odors from my breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8421.a;It is nice to have.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8422.desc;The perfumer excitedly shows me his musk perfume. I take a sniff, and note it smells pleasant the way animal musk usually does. Then the perfumer tells me his secret: it is not musk made from animals, but from the oil of the seeds of a medicinal plant, known as the musk mallow, ambrette, or rose mallow. I was fooled there for a good moment!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8422.a;A fun idea. I'll buy some!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8422.b;Let me get some for my spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8422.c;A nice novelty, but I am not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8423.desc;The servant asks if I want some mustard seed with my meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8423.a;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8423.b;A good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8424.desc;You pass by the market and see a peddler peddling his goods, in particular various spices and herbs. He has a lot of nutmeg this time, and is selling it for a little cheaper than he usually does. When you sample a bit, it is clear that this is real nutmeg and not an attempt at fraud.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8424.a;What are we waiting for? I'll buy some!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8424.b;It's good nutmeg, but I don't need more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8425.desc;I was eating some delicious nutmeg flavored sweets when I started feeling unusually ill. My physician said it seems I simply ate too much nutmeg, which in large doses can cause a variety of symptoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8425.a;Hopefully it goes away soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8426.desc;Someone presented me with a large gift of oregano.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8426.a;Looks like we will eat a lot of that for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8427.desc;I received a gift of some orris oil, made from the orris root. It has a variety of uses. What should I do with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8427.a;Give it to a perfumer, obviously, to make perfumes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8427.b;Allow my cooks use it as tincture to flavor syrup.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8427.c;Let my physician have access for his herbal medicines.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8428.desc;We have decorated our hair ornaments with kewra, a fragrance made from the pandan palm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8428.a;It smells nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8429.desc;My cooks have just received a shipment of parsley to use in my food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8429.a;More parsley!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8430.desc;You have heard that the some ancient people held parsley to be paradoxically sacred and evil, for it first sprouted from the blood of one of their heroes according to their legends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8430.a;Come on, that's silly and makes no sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8430.b;Perhaps there is logic behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8431.desc;I was warned by an elderly servant not to touch or eat parsley. "If you love someone," she said, "then bad things will happen and ruin your love. Parsley is a useful herb, but it is also evil!";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8431.a;Ha, that's just an old wives tale.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8431.b;Thank you for telling me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8432.desc;You happen to pass through the countryside when you encounter a farmer. Curious about what he does, you ask him about what he grows and the land he farms on, and notice there is one spot he avoids. "Too much parsley grows there," he explains, "and everyone knows that parsley are the herbs that visit hell. ‘tis bad luck.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8432.a;That is very wise of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8432.b;What silly superstition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8433.desc;You put too much pepper on your food.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8433.a;I'll bear with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8433.b;Don't eat it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8434.desc;I sit at the windowsill, staring outside. What do I see far away that I observe with great scrutiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8434.a;Nature's somber awe - plants, the skies, the sun before me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8434.b;A group of peasant children playing games outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8434.c;Some of my guardsmen marching around on patrol.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.8435.desc;In my dream, I live in a large mansion of unrivaled beauty, so vast it could not have been built by mundane means. It is a gorgeous residence where I have all the comforts of home - food, drink, and entertainment at my beck and call, and all manner of exotic mechanical and magical contraptions. And yet I am trapped. Every time I try to escape, I end up coming back, somehow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8435.a;This is no way to live! I must be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8435.b;Since it is here before me, I guess I can enjoy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8435.c;Only fools take for granted the gifts they're given.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8436.desc;You pass by a small ancient ruin while traveling through a village. The peasant acting as your guide tells you of a local folk legend, that centuries ago when a plague struck the area, one of the locals holed himself up in the ruin - as it was his house back then - and died there by himself when he ran out of food and drink. His lonely spirit, supposedly, still haunts the area to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8436.a;An interesting tale, I suppose!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8437.desc;One of my courtiers has been spending time at home an awful lot as of late. When I went to investigate, I learned that they recently picked up board games as a hobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8437.a;Perhaps I can play a game or two with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8437.b;It's a childish waste of their time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8437.c;I can teach you some strategies for your favorite game.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8438.desc;I am pacing back and forth inside my residence, thinking about this or that, and then I accidentally bump into some of the furniture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8438.a;Whoops! Silly me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8439.desc;Some of my young maidservants screamed in terror when a mouse scurried past us one morning. The mouse was nowhere to be found after a quick search, but some of the girls are still scared and worry there may be more mice at my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8439.a;Poor children. Worry not, the mouse is gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8439.b;Come on now. Grow up already, be a little brave!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8439.c;The mice are our brothers and sisters, we should respect them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8439.d;A worrisome sight! We must remain vigilant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8440.desc;I was bored at home with nothing to do one day, so I decided to take a walk around when I overheard some muffled sounds coming from a room. I snuck over and opened the door slightly, and peeked inside. One of my maids and one of my manservants were making love and in the throes of passion, oblivious to the world around them! Though young, they should know better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8440.a;Barge in and order them to stop doing this in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8440.b;Secretly watch them eagerly but don't tell them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8440.c;Forget it - it is none of my business.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8440.d;Tell them later they have your blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8441.desc;A loud noise is heard outside and on instinct I rush to the window, curious. I look out and see nothing out of the ordinary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8441.a;Odd. Is my imagination playing tricks on me?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8442.desc;I've been staying up a lot lately out of boredom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8442.a;It's not a healthy thing, but I can't resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8442.b;I'll try to make the most of my bad habit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8443.desc;I visited a friend of mine recently. As we took a walk outside and made small talk, they wanted to offer me a present. It turned out to be an oddly shaped metal stick, so I was offended at first. "This is a very good lockpick," I was told. "Once you get the hang of it, you can open any lock. I don't need it, but I think even a great [Root.GetTitle] like you could find use for it.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8443.a;Ah! An intriguing gift... but one that could come in handy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8443.b;I am a [Root.GetTitle] - I leave dirty work to my spies and assassins!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8444.desc;I am at a local banquet when the host presents me with a ceramic tankard as a gift. While simple in design, it was clearly created by an expert craftsman, so though I may not necessarily use it in more formal occasions like a great feast, I could keep it for everyday use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8444.a;Thank you for the thoughtful gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8444.b;It is too plain for a [Root.GetTitle] like me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8445.desc;A gang of female thieves had been recently preying on male travelers in the nearby area with a unique method. They would first seduce them and offer them erotic delights. Afterwards, they would entice their victim to strip naked. When their victim's guard was down, they would steal the man's belongings before running off, leaving the victim naked and humiliated. Your guards had difficulty catching the culprits until a cunning adventurer helped them ambush the thieves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8445.a;Very good. I don't have money for a reward, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8445.b;Quite impressive. This gift of gold shall do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8445.c;Pay them and request they give our guards some tips for the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8445.d;What a talented person - I need them with me at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_siren_anvil_adventurer_hire;The adventurer will join your court, providing you valuable services with their knowledge and skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8446.desc;In my dream last night, I lived in a beautiful cottage. Though simple, it had all manner of convenience, and I had all the food, drink, and entertainment I needed to live a happy life. When I woke up, I found myself missing the place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8446.a;It was a nice dream, all said.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8447.desc;As you walk through your residence one evening, by chance you look outside - and there, before you, is a most spectacular sight. The sun is setting, and it looks gorgeous. You gaze, speechless, as you admire the union of yellow, orange, red, and pink colors that shine through the few clouds in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8447.a;Amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8448.desc;You recently heard tales of a land where the sun is always shining, the flowers are always blooming, fruits are always hanging from the trees, and the waters are calm and of a beautiful light blue color. It is said that if one travels far across the sea, one will eventually reach this hidden paradise, and that the natives will welcome one like kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8448.a;Ha! If I kept sailing across the ocean I doubt I'd find such a land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8448.b;One day someone will travel the seas to conquer this land, I'm sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8448.c;The question is whether the natives follow the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8449.desc;We were traveling in the wilderness when we came across an old ruin. The locals say it was built by long-lost inhabitants of this land, and was perhaps once used as a fortress, or a tomb, or a shrine. We shall never know, for all that remains are a few stones and one lone column. At any rate, my entourage and I rested there for a while, before we made our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8449.a;Will our monuments be like those ruins, too, one day?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8450.desc;The baklava bakers of [Root.GetName] have gained some fame as the best in the region. Some people will travel far and wide to sample the tasty, sugary, syrupy delights that the area has become known for.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8450.a;Delicious! That reminds me, I need to buy some baklava.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8451.desc;An exotic traveler from a faraway land is visiting my court today. Though an older gentleman, there is a handsome quality to him that can only come with the wisdom of old age. He has strange but thoughtful ideas, so I enjoy talking with him. We are discussing many fascinating matters when he asks me, "Have you ever heard of Scarborough Fair?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8451.a;"Perhaps..." I answer, "but what do you mean by that?";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8452.title;Scarborough Fair;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8452.desc;"Scarborough is an actual place, but the song, Scarborough Fair, is a most profound ballad about human existence," he says. When I ask him to explain, he sings the song to me:\n\n"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.\nRemember me to one who lives there\nShe once was a true love of mine."\n\nThe man smiles and hands me a piece of paper. "Though it is an impossible task, we are all traveling to Scarborough Fair, dear friend. keep my copy of the lyrics so you can study the wisdom in its words.";;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8452.a;He smiles at me kindly as I accept his gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_swansong_scarborough_fair;"At the end of the road, of the journey we all must take, no matter how impossible, is Scarborough Fair....";;;;;;;;;;;;x
